<h4>POPPY OTT</h4>
</div>


<p>I guess you know who I am. My name is Jerry
Todd. I have written a lot of books about myself.
I’m writing this book, too. But it’s mostly
about another boy. A new kid. I’ll tell you about
him.</p>

<p>You see, to start with, I live in Tutter. Our
town is the best small town in Illinois. Boy, we
have fun! In the summer time, I mean. One
reason why we have so much fun, I guess, is because
we have a smart leader. Scoop Ellery is
the gnat’s knuckles, let me tell you, when it comes
to thinking up interesting things to do. Peg Shaw
is a member of our gang, too. He’s a great big
guy. To look at him you’d think he was three
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
years older than Scoop and me. But he isn’t. He
just grew up faster. His folks fed him a lot of
tough beefsteak, I guess. Anyway, that’s what we
tell him in fun. We’re all in the same grade at
school. Even Red Meyers, who is a sort of runt
with freckles parked all over his face and a brick-colored
topknot.</p>

<p>Well, to jump into my story, Red and I
started out one summer morning right after breakfast
to have an early-morning swim in the creek in
Happy Hollow. This is a peachy place to
swim. The willows growing there make it cool
and shady even in the hottest weather. You
never saw a place so crammed full of willows.
It’s a regular jungle. Tramps hang out there in
the summer time. But they don’t bother us when
we go there. We leave them alone and they leave
us alone. They know they’ve got to behave themselves.
If they didn’t the Tutter marshal would
lock them up in the town jail. Sometimes Bill
Hadley does lock them up to get rid of them.
After a night in jail they’re glad enough to get out
of town.</p>

<p>Red and I ran into a couple of tramps this
morning on our way to the swimming hole. One
was a man, a quite oldish man, and the other
was a boy our age. Say, I wish you could have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
seen the outfit they had! It was a sort of ramshackle
bungalow built on a rickety four-wheeled
wagon. The house had side windows, all of different
shapes and sizes. There was a back door
and a little back porch with a rickety railing.
Up in front a stovepipe poked its rusted snout
through the roof. Like everything else in the outfit
the stovepipe was wabbly and ready to fall to
pieces. It was some tacky outfit, all right. The
wonder to me was that it didn’t fall to pieces in
traveling the country roads.</p>

<p>An old gray horse was staked out close to the
wagon. Talk about a <em>sway-back</em>! Say, that old
four-legged washboard had a gully in its back as
deep as the Illinois River. On the bottom side
its stomach bagged worse than the knees of Cap’n
Tinkertop’s everyday pants. It was awfully
proud of its ribs, or so it would seem, for every
rib was shoved out in plain sight. The tail was
bobbed. To help the old skate switch away the
mosquitoes and flies its owner had fastened a
frazzled-out rope to the stub. The old nag sure
did look funny swishing its rope tail. Red and I
had a good laugh to ourselves.</p>

<p>“Some outfit,” says my chum, taking in the
rickety traveling bungalow and the ten-cent horse.</p>

<p>“That must be the guy who owns it,” says I,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
pointing to a stoop-shouldered old man who had
pottered into sight from the deeper willows.</p>

<p>The newcomer hadn’t seen us. And shuffling
up to the bungalow, he rapped on a window.</p>

<p>“Poppy,” says he. “Poppy Ott. You git up
now. Or I’ll come in thar with a stick.”</p>

<p>Some one inside yawned like a young steam
engine.</p>

<p>“<em>Poppy!</em>” says the old man, sharper-like.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh,” says a sleepy voice.</p>

<p>“You git up now,” says the old man. “You
hear me? You hain’t took care of Julius Cæsar
yet. An’ I’ve got to go to town on business.”</p>

<p>Here a tousle-headed kid came into sight on
the bungalow’s fancy back porch. And at sight
of him Red pinched my hand and giggled.</p>

<p>“Lookit, Jerry,” says he, pointing. “Huckleberry
Finn has come to town.”</p>

<p>The kid was a dead-ringer for Huckleberry
Finn, all right. His shirt was ripped at the neck
and his pants were three sizes too big for him.
They hung on him like Charley Chaplin’s pants.
And did a kid ever have dirtier feet! <em>Good</em> night!
I wondered what his bed sheets looked like.</p>

<p>“Did you eat, Pa?” says the kid, stretching and
yawning.</p>

<p>“Two hours ago,” says the old man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
“Leave anything?”</p>

<p>“They’s some stuff under the wagon.”</p>

<p>While the kid was messing around in a box
where food was kept, the old man got out a whisk
broom and dusted his clothes. He looked pretty
respectable when he got through.</p>

<p>Red got my ear.</p>

<p>“Lookit, Jerry! What’s he doing now?”</p>

<p>“Polishing something,” says I.</p>

<p>“It’s a badge,” says Red, sort of breathless-like.
“A policeman’s badge. Gee! He must be
a detective.”</p>

<p>“Yah,” says I, in a sudden cold feeling toward
the old man. “Like old Mr. Arnoldsmith.”</p>

<p>If you have read my book, JERRY TODD
AND THE WHISPERING MUMMY, you’ll
remember Mr. Anson Arnoldsmith. The old
shyster! He gyped me out of a dollar and a quarter.
And ever since then I’ve been leary about
meeting “detectives.”</p>

<p>Red was excited.</p>

<p>“I bet he <em>is</em> a detective, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“I’d sooner think he was a dog catcher,” says I.</p>

<p>“I don’t see any dogs.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s got ’em in the wagon,” I laughed.</p>

<p>“We’ll help him, Jerry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
“We’ll keep away from him,” says I quickly,
thinking of old Mr. Arnoldsmith.</p>

<p>“We can detect, too,” says Red. “We know
how.”</p>

<p>“If he’s a detective,” says I, “he better detect
a bar of soap and a scrubbing brush and get busy
on his little Poppy.”</p>

<p>Red snickered.</p>

<p>“Poppy,” says he, speaking the boy’s name.
“<em>Some</em> name.”</p>

<p>“They ought to call him squash blossom,” says
I. “For he looks more like a muddy squash than
he does a poppy.”</p>

<p>The old man put his polished badge out of
sight under his coat.</p>

<p>“Now, Poppy,” says he, businesslike, sort of
working his shoulders up and down to make his
coat fit better, “you jest curry Julius Cæsar, like I
tell you, an’ brush him down nice an’ neat. An’
when you git that job done you better git up on
the roof with some tar an’ see ’bout fixin’ that hole
whar it rained in on me last night. I’ve told you
before ’bout fixin’ it. So git busy now an’ do it.
Fur it may rain ag’in to-night. An’ I hain’t awantin’
to wake up like I did last night an’ find
my mouth plum full of rain water. You hear
me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
“Yes, Pa,” says the kid, over the top of a hunk
of bread.</p>

<p>As this was the first boy tramp we had ever seen
our curiosity was aroused. It would be fun, we
thought, to talk to him and thus get his story.
For undoubtedly in traveling here and there he
had met with a lot of exciting adventures. So we
decided to stick around.</p>

<p>Finishing his breakfast, the kid got out a currycomb
and brush and began massaging the ribs
of the four-legged washboard. He kept at this
job until his father had pottered out of sight in
the direction of town. Then he sat down on a
stump and sort of buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>Red was puzzled in watching the other.</p>

<p>“What’s he doing now, Jerry? Crying?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go over and find out,” says I.</p>

<p>“Aw!... He wouldn’t want us to catch him
crying. He’d be ashamed.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s sick,” says I, “and needs attention.”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> aren’t a doctor.”</p>

<p>“I can give him a stomach rub,” says I, grinning.</p>

<p>“Yah, and probably <em>he</em> can give you a punch in
the snout if you get smart with him. He looks
tough. You better stay here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Here the kid lifted his face. We saw then
that he hadn’t been crying. He had been thinking
about something, like a fellow does sometimes
when he’s troubled. And whatever his thoughts
had been they had led him along until he was the
maddest kid imaginable.</p>

<p>Getting up from his seat, he jumped up and
down in his mad streak, sort of shaking his
clenched fists. Say, he acted like he was crazy.
We could hear him talking to himself, too. But
we couldn’t make out what he was saying, for we
were too far away.</p>

<p>“What the dickens?...” says Red, blinking
puzzled-like at the strange-acting one. “What’s
wrong with him?”</p>

<p>“Maybe he sat down on a hornet,” says I.</p>

<p>“Aw!...”</p>

<p>“Go over and put a nickel in him,” says I, in
further nonsense, “and see if he’ll play a tune.”</p>

<p>“Sh-h-h-h!” says Red. “He’ll hear you.”</p>

<p>Sort of quieting down, the kid went back to his
currying job. We watched him for several minutes,
wondering what was next on the program.
Pretty soon he put away his currycomb and brush
and went over to the bungalow. I figured that he
was going to climb on the roof and sling some tar,
as his father had ordered him to do. Instead he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
thoughtfully walked around and around the
wagon, sort of squinting at it and shaking his
head. Taking hold of a wheel, he gave it a shake.
Golly Ned! The old bungalow rattled in its
wabbly joints like the skeleton that Doc Leland
donated to the Tutter public school. I <em>know</em> how
that old skeleton rattles, for one day I fixed some
strings to it and the teacher was so scared when
it waved its bony hands at her that she almost
jumped out of her skin.

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Well, we were right-down curious about the
strange kid now. He was up to something. We
could see that plain enough. So we decided to
stick around a while longer.</p>

<p>Going back to where the old nag was staked
out in a grassy spot, the kid did something to the
horse that made it kick. Bingo! Up went its
rope tail and out shot its hind feet like a double-barreled
battering ram.</p>

<p>Red grabbed my arm when the young horse
tender led his nag over to the wagon and backed
it up against a front wheel.</p>

<p>“<em>Good</em> night! He’s making his old horse kick
the wagon to pieces. Lookit, Jerry! <a id="wheels"></a>There goes
the two hind wheels.”</p>

<p>The four wagon wheels kicked to pieces, the
kid led the horse back to its pasture and then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
squatted, contented-like, in the shade of a tree
with a book.</p>

<p>“I wonder what got into him,” says Red, completely
puzzled.</p>

<p>“He’s cuckoo,” says I.</p>

<p>“Aw! ... It’s only old men who get cuckoo.”</p>

<p>“How about yourself?” says I, grinning.</p>

<p>“You aren’t funny,” says he.</p>

<p>Well, we stuck around. There’d be some excitement,
we figured, when the old man came home
and found his bungalow squatting on the ground
instead of on wheels. As for the kid, he sure had
us guessing with his queer actions. We couldn’t
make him out at all. And curious, too, about the
book that he was reading, we crawled closer.</p>

<p>“It’s a schoolbook,” says Red. “What do you
know about that?—<em>him</em> studying an arithmetic!”</p>

<p>The kid had paper and a pencil. He was working
problems. One problem seemed to stump him.
He figured and figured. But he couldn’t get the
right answer.</p>

<p>Suddenly he looked up and caught our eyes.</p>

<p>“Say,” says he, as unconcerned over our presence
as you please, “can you kids do fractions?”</p>

<p>We felt foolish in being caught. We hadn’t
figured on this. We had thought to ourselves
that we were too smart to be caught. I had to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
admit to myself now that the kid wasn’t as much
of a squash as I had let myself believe.</p>

<p>“I can’t get this problem,” says he, and he dug
at his tousled hair with his pencil, looking more
puzzled than ever. “It’s about a steamboat.
Going up stream the steamboat travels sixteen and
two-thirds miles per hour. Going down stream it
travels twenty-seven and one-half miles per hour.
It is three hours and seventeen minutes longer
going up stream than down. How far did it go?”</p>

<p>Red and I had had that problem in school. So
we got busy and worked it. And now that I was
close to the kid I saw what bright, snappy eyes
he had. I liked his looks. He interested me.
And I kind of forgot about his old clothes and
dirty bare feet.</p>

<p>“I suppose you wonder,” says he, putting away
his arithmetic, “why I made old Julius Cæsar kick
the wagon wheels to pieces.”</p>

<p>“Did you know we were watching you?” says I,
in surprise.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“I saw you kids in the weeds,” says he, “when
I first got out of bed.”</p>

<p>Red and I traded sheepish glances.</p>

<p>“We thought we were hid,” says I.</p>

<p>That made the ragged one grin. And in that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
moment I liked him better than ever. For he
had a good grin. I could see that he would make
a swell pal, all right. He was smart, too.</p>

<p>And I had called him a squash! I wanted to
kick myself at the thought of it. It was <em>me</em> who
was the squash.</p>

<p>Then, taking a liking to us, he told us his
story. Maybe we thought it was fun, he said,
thoughtful-like, to travel around the country like
a tramp and skip school and go dirty. But for his
part he was sick and tired of the lazy, shiftless
life.</p>

<p>“That is what I was thinking about when you
saw me on the stump,” says he. “I felt pretty
blue. Things were getting worse for us. In
thinking about it I got mad. And I suddenly made
up my mind that I’d stay right here. I wouldn’t
go a step farther, I said. Pa, of course, would kick
on that. <em>He</em> would want to keep on going until
the old wagon dropped to pieces in the middle of
the road. Thinking about the old wagon dropping
to pieces sort of put an idea in my head. Why
not fix the wagon, says I, so he <em>couldn’t</em> move it?
Then he’d have to stay here and settle down and
be somebody, like other men. So I got busy. You
saw what I did.... Say, can you tell me where
I can get a job?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
“How old are you?” says I.</p>

<p>“Fifteen,” says he.</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to be sixteen,” says I, “to get a
job in this state. I know, for my dad runs a brickyard.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to get a job of some kind,” says he,
determined-like. “For one of us has got to work
if we’re going to eat.”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t your father get a job?” says Red.</p>

<p>The kid laughed at that.</p>

<p>“Pa work!” says he. “That’s funny. He’s too
busy detecting to work.”</p>

<p>Red was excited again.</p>

<p>“Is your pa a detective?”</p>

<p>“He thinks he is,” says the kid.</p>

<p>“We saw his badge,” says Red.</p>

<p>“Yes,” says the kid, nodding, “he takes a lot
of pride in that tin badge of his. It cost him six
dollars. I had a row with him the day he sent
for it. I told him that the detective company he
was writing to was a fake and all they wanted out
of him was his money. But he wouldn’t listen to
me. And ever since then he’s been making a
monkey of himself. Some detective, <em>he</em> is. Huh!
He’s my own father, and I suppose I ought to
stick up for him, but if he was anybody else’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
father I’d say he was an old dumb-bell. When
Ma was alive she sort of kept him busy. Still, he
didn’t do very much work at that. He’d sit
around the kitchen reading his old detective books
and let her take in family washings. When she
died he just quit working altogether. That was
two years ago. Look at me! Here I am fifteen
years old and I haven’t been in the eighth grade
yet.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t worry me,” says Red, who hates
school, “if I never got in the eighth grade or any
other grade.”</p>

<p>“I thought it was fun at first,” says the kid, “to
skip school. But I feel different about it now.
For I can see that a fellow has got to go to school
or be a dumb-bell like Pa. And it’s a cinch I
don’t want to grow up and be like <em>him</em>. I guess
not. I want to go to school, I do. And I’m going
to go to school, too—right here in Tutter. I’ve
made up my mind to that.”</p>

<p>I was looking at the flattened wagon wheels.</p>

<p>“What’ll your pa say,” says I, “when he comes
home and sees the wreck?”</p>

<p>The kid shrugged.</p>

<p>“He’ll be mad, of course. But I should worry.”</p>

<p>“Will he lick you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
“<em>Lick</em> me? Pa? Shucks, he couldn’t catch me.
Besides,” came the easy laugh, “why should he lick
<em>me</em>? <em>I</em> didn’t do it. Old Julius Cæsar did it.”</p>

<p>“When’s your pa coming back?” says Red.</p>

<p>“Oh, when he gets through sleuthing ... if
he doesn’t get locked up in the town jail. He’s
been in jail three times this summer. That’s the
kind of a detective <em>he</em> is. Probably right now he’s
crawling along some alley on his hands and knees
searching for finger prints, or something like that.
He tries to be like the detectives in books. It
makes me sick. No wonder the cops lock him up
on suspicion.”</p>

<p>Red grinned.</p>

<p>“He ought to show the cops his detective badge.
Then they wouldn’t lock him up.”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble,” says the kid. “It’s his
tin badge that gives him away.”</p>

<p>“And he isn’t a real detective?” says Red, disappointed.</p>

<p>“<em>Him?</em> Of course not. But he thinks he is,
as I say. And snooping into things that are none
of his business is what gets him into trouble.”</p>

<p>“We were down this way yesterday,” says I,
“but you weren’t here then.”</p>

<p>“We pulled in late last night,” says the kid.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
“Pa’s been crazy to get here. He’s been talking
about coming here ever since he started working
on that black-parrot case.”</p>

<p>Red pricked up his ears in new interest.</p>

<p>“Black-parrot case,” says he. “What do you
mean by that?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a real parrot,” says the kid, “but it
could talk like a parrot. And it was coal black. I
think it was a mino bird. Yes, that is the name.
It came from India. A woman in Cedarburg
owned it. Mrs. Casper Strange. And when it
was stolen she offered a reward of a thousand
dollars for its return.”</p>

<p>“A thousand-dollar parrot!” says Red. “I
can’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she has oodles of money! A thousand
dollars doesn’t mean anything to her. We lived
in Cedarburg, you know. Pa told her that he was
a detective and would get her parrot for her. So
she hired him. That is, she told him she would
pay him a thousand dollars if he was successful.”</p>

<p>I was puzzled.</p>

<p>“But why did your pa come <em>here</em>?” says I.
“You say he was crazy to get here. Does he
think the stolen parrot is in Tutter?”</p>

<p>“Search me,” says the kid, shrugging. “All
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
of a sudden he got a notion to come here, as I
say. And here we are.”</p>

<p>Red laughed.</p>

<p>“Maybe he came here to search old Cap’n
Tinkertop’s bird store.”</p>

<p>The kid gave the speaker a quick look.</p>

<p>“Old Cap’n Tinkertop,” says he.</p>

<p>“He’s a friend of ours,” says Red. “He runs
a parrot store.”</p>

<p>A queer look came into the kid’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” says he at length, “if Pa is as dumb
in his detective work as I thought. Tinkertop!
That was the name of a man who worked for the
rich Cedarburg woman.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t the Cap’n,” says I quickly. “For he’s
lived in Tutter for years.”</p>

<p>“<em>Ham</em> Tinkertop,” says the kid after a moment.
“That was the man’s name. He used to
be a sailor.”</p>

<p>“I know,” says Red quickly. “Ham Tinkertop
and the Cap’n were brothers. Don’t you remember,
Jerry?—the brother died and the Cap’n
went away to the funeral. And when he came
home he had a lot of money. That was when he
started up his bird store.”</p>

<p>I <em>did</em> remember about the Cap’n going away
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
to his brother’s funeral. And at the time of the
old man’s return I had wondered at his sudden
wealth.</p>

<p>“When was it,” says the kid, “that this old
friend of yours was in Cedarburg to his brother’s
funeral?”</p>

<p>“The week of my birthday,” says Red.
“Around the tenth of June.”</p>

<p>“That was the week,” says the kid, “that the
black parrot was stolen.”</p>

<p>I looked at my chum and he looked at me.</p>

<p>“Come on,” says I, taking his arm. “Let’s
snap into it and find Scoop Ellery. He ought to
know about this.”

<h4>
IN THE PARROT STORE</h4>
</div>


<p>As I say, old Cap’n Tinkertop had brought
home a wad of money from his brother’s funeral.
The dead sailor had been buried in Cedarburg.
The week of the funeral a valuable black parrot
had been stolen from a wealthy Cedarburg woman
for whom the dead sailor had worked. We had
just gotten that story from the Ott kid. And in
consequence I now had the troubled suspicion that
there might be some unworthy connection between
our old friend’s sudden wealth and the vanished
bird. I couldn’t figure it out. But I felt that
Scoop Ellery could. For he’s smart in solving
mysteries. So Red and I turned back into town to
find the leader and tell him the story exactly as
the Ott kid had told it to us.</p>

<p>“I bet you,” says Red, as we jogged along,
“that the old man came here on a clew.”</p>

<p>“You mean Mr. Ott?” says I.</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
“He’s shadowing the Cap’n. See?”</p>

<p>I was puzzled.</p>

<p>“But why should the Cap’n steal a parrot at
his brother’s funeral?”</p>

<p>“That’s the mystery.”</p>

<p>“And if he did steal it,” says I, “where is it?”</p>

<p>“More mystery,” says Red.</p>

<p>“Do you think Poppy’s father suspects that the
Cap’n has the parrot here?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. He’s got a clew, I tell you.
That’s what brought him here.”</p>

<p>The Cap’n’s bird store is in a little old building
on School Street, which is one of our main business
streets. This is the same building where
Spider Phelps ran his shooting gallery the winter
poor Mrs. Higgins sneezed her false teeth halfway
across the Methodist church when they were
giving out the Christmas presents. We had
helped our old one-legged friend move his shabby
furniture and other truck into the rooms in the
back part of the store. And we had helped him
put up his sign. Here it is:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Cap’n Boaz Tinkertop’s</i><br>
<br>
<i>BIRD STORE</i><br>
<br>
<i>Our Parrots are the “Talk” of the Town</i><br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
Turning into School Street on a dog-trot, our
ears were suddenly punctured by one of the
screechiest screeches you could imagine. It came
from the parrot store. And when we got there,
there was Red’s aunt, Mrs. Pansy Biggle, standing
on a store chair sort of flopping her feet up
and down like a dancing duck and jiggling her
skirts. Boy, she looked funny. I had to laugh.
She’s kind of fat. I guess she weighs three hundred
pounds. One time she had a husband, but
he fell in the river, or something, and they never
found him again. She lives at Red’s house and
runs a down-town store for women. Sells hats
and dresses. Her store is just across the street
from the Cap’n’s store. Last winter she had
Micky Gallagher, the one-eyed Tutter carpenter,
saw a hunk out of her front door so that she
could go in and out in her new fur coat without
wedging.</p>

<p>I couldn’t imagine what in time was the matter
with her. Then I got my eyes on a small white
thing skittering around on the floor. And, boy,
did I ever laugh! All this fuss over a little white
mouse! And a tame mouse at that.</p>

<p>The parrots in the store were screeching like a
train of runaway cars on a rusty track. I could
hear a shrill chattering sound, too. And when I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
looked closer I saw a small monkey hopping
around on the floor.</p>

<p>I knew then what had happened. The butcher’s
pet monkey from next door had gotten into the
bird store and had let the white mice out of their
cage. And now the monkey was twitching feathers
out of the parrots’ tails. No wonder the
helpless birds were screeching bloody murder!</p>

<p>Well, a lot of people came on the gallop to see
who was being murdered. Old Mr. Blighty was
one of the first ones there. He thought the store
was on fire. And what do you know if he didn’t
skedaddle to the corner on his rheumatic legs and
turn in a fire alarm. Some one else turned in the
police call. And pretty soon Bill Hadley, the
town marshal, came scooting into sight in his
police flivver. The fire truck came, too, rippety-tear,
and the firemen ran the hose out and started
squirting water into the bird store. That was an
awful unlucky thing for Red’s aunt. For she got
a squirt of water plum in the face. She quit
screeching then. She couldn’t screech, I guess.
Her screecher was clogged with water.</p>

<p>Cap’n Tinkertop was in the back part of his
store playing checkers with old Caleb Obed.
That’s the lazy Cap’n for you! He doesn’t take
care of his business at all. We’ve had to run his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
store for him ever since he started it. All he
does is play checkers and fool away his time. He
thinks he is the best checker player in Tutter.
And old Caleb has the same conceited opinion of
himself. So every day they fight it out in the
back part of the store. They were so deep in
their game now that they never knew that anything
unusual was going on up in front.</p>

<p>The firemen were mad as hops when they
learned that there wasn’t any fire. Bill Hadley
was roaring mad, too. My, but didn’t he prance
around! I kind of kept out of reach of his club.
I didn’t want him to get the frisky idea that I had
anything to do with the two false alarms.</p>

<p>Scoop and Peg were there. And when the
crowd melted away the four of us went into the
store to see how much damage had been done.
The place was a wreck, all right. The caged parrots
looked more like half-drowned cats than
birds. Red’s aunt looked half-drowned, too.
And, boy, was she up on her ear! She’s forever
laying the law down to Red. He gets blamed for
everything. And now she lit into him right.</p>

<p>Scoop sort of took charge of the store, being
the leader.</p>

<p>“Is there anything I can do for you to-day, Mrs.
Biggle?” says he, wading behind the counter, his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
shoes going slosh! slosh! slosh! in the water on
the floor.</p>

<p>“I think you’ve done enough,” says the angry
milliner, sort of snapping it out like a dog fighting
another dog for a bone. She got down from
her perch, still glaring at poor Red. “Just look
at my dress! It’s rooned.”</p>

<p>Scoop didn’t say anything to that. He just let
her talk. So did Red. And pretty soon she
calmed down. Her parrot had escaped, she said.
That is what had brought her into the store. She
had come on the run to ask the Cap’n how to coax
the bird back into its cage.</p>

<p>Our leader told her that we would do the parrot-catching
act for her. We were the best parrot
catchers in the county, he bragged, grinning. And
when she had gone he started giving us our orders.
We were to get out and scout around, he said.
And if we got sight of the parrot we were to report
to him.</p>

<p>Before I had a chance to tell the leader about
the mystery that Red and I had stumbled into,
the old detective himself meandered into the store.</p>

<p>At sight of the newcomer Scoop clutched my
arm, excited-like.</p>

<p>“That’s him, Jerry,” says he in a low voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
“Do you know him?” says I, surprised.</p>

<p>“This morning I caught him snooping in the
store. When I asked him what he wanted he
said he was looking around to see if we had any
black parrots. I told him that our parrots were
all green and yellow. But he hung on. He
wanted to get a black parrot, he said. He seemed
to think we ought to have one in stock.”</p>

<p>“He’s a detective,” says I.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“He’s looking for a black parrot that was
stolen from a rich woman in Cedarburg,” says I.</p>

<p>The leader stared at me for a moment or two.
And in watching his face I could see that he was
putting something together in his mind.</p>

<p>“Cedarburg,” says he. “Why, that’s the town
where the Cap’n’s brother used to live.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” says I, nodding. “And this black
parrot that I’m telling you about was stolen the
week the Cap’n was there to his brother’s funeral.”</p>

<p>Speaking quickly and in a low voice, I told the
leader about the Ott kid and about the stolen mino
bird. While we were talking the old detective
pottered out of the store and disappeared in the
street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
“Say, who was that old prune, anyway?” says
Peg, heaving across the room to where we were.</p>

<p>“He’s a detective,” says I.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose he asked me for?”</p>

<p>Scoop grinned.</p>

<p>“A black parrot?”</p>

<p>“How did you know?” says Peg.</p>

<p>“Oh, I waited on him this morning.”</p>

<p>“We better ring up Bill Hadley,” says Peg,
naming the marshal, “and have him unlock one
of his padded cells and shove this old geezer in.
For that’s where he belongs. A black parrot!
Haw! haw! haw! He’ll be asking for a ringtailed
caterpillar next.”</p>

<p>Scoop shook his head thoughtful-like.</p>

<p>“The old man isn’t cuckoo, Peg. As Jerry
says, he’s a detective. He’s working on a parrot
case.”</p>

<p>Then we told the big one about the stolen
black parrot.</p>

<p>“But there’s no black parrot here,” says he,
looking around the store.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that,” says Scoop. There
was a queer tone to his voice now, and I watched
him curiously as he fished a piece of crumpled
paper out of his pocket. “The old man dropped
this clipping on the floor when he was here this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
morning. It came out of his pocket with his
handkerchief. It’s an ad out of a newspaper.
Read it.”</p>

<p>Peg and I hooked the clipping, eager to see it.
Here it is:</p>

<p class="unindent indent5 small">FOR SALE: Genuine black parrot. Talker.<br>
Address Lock Box 23, Tutter, Illinois.</p>

<p>“Why,” says Peg, “that’s the Cap’n’s post-office
box number.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” says Scoop.</p>

<p>“Evidently,” says I, using my head, “the old
detective saw this ad in the newspaper. That is
what brought him here.”</p>

<p>“It’s the clew I told you about,” says Red
promptly.</p>

<p>“But if the Cap’n has the stolen parrot,” says
Peg, puzzled, “where is it? And why in Sam
Hill did he steal it?”</p>

<p>“The old man’s queer,” says Scoop, trying to
account for the act.</p>

<p>“Queer and tricky both,” says I, remembering
some things that had happened in the store that
were of no particular credit to our old friend,
like the time he sold the swearing parrot to the
Presbyterian minister and lied about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
“You’re right,” says Scoop, nodding. “And if
he’s up to some kind of trickery in this ‘black
parrot’ deal, we ought to cut in on him and stop
him. For we’re taking care of him, sort of. And
we’ve got to see that he doesn’t do anything
crooked.”</p>

<p>“If he stole the parrot,” says Peg, “<em>that’s</em>
crooked.”</p>

<p>“Of course. But <em>did</em> he steal it? We don’t
know that he did. I hope he didn’t.”</p>

<p>Red had gone to answer the telephone.</p>

<p>“Hey!” says he. “My aunt wants to know if
we’ve seen anything of her parrot yet.”</p>

<p>Scoop started for the door.</p>

<p>“Come on, Jerry. You, too, Red. Peg, you
stay here and run the store. If old Sherlock
Holmes comes in again, pump him. Pump the
Cap’n, too, if you can. We’ll be back in an hour
or so.”</p>

<h4>THE STUTTERING PARROT</h4>


<p>We were crazy to begin work on the mystery
that had bobbed up in front of us. But we had no
chance to do any regular detecting that morning.
For we had to scour the town in search of Red’s
aunt’s escaped parrot.</p>

<p>At noon we were ready to give up the search.
We were tuckered out. It’s no fun, let me tell
you, traipsing around in the hot sun for hours at
a time. I had a crook in the back of my neck
from squinting into treetops.</p>

<p>At the store Peg told us that the milliner had
been called into Chicago on sudden important business.
She wasn’t likely to be back for several
days, he said. So we decided to discontinue our
parrot hunting for the day. Anyway, as the leader
said, the parrot would probably come home of
its own accord when it got dark. So why chase
our legs off in the hot sun trying to find it?</p>

<p>Peg then told us that the Cap’n and old Caleb
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
had gone fishing in the Illinois River. So we
gave the parrots their usual dinner of boiled corn,
after which we did some house-cleaning in the
rooms in the back part of the store. We have to
do that for the Cap’n. Having a peg-leg, it’s hard
for him to get around. Anyway, to come right
out with the truth, he isn’t very particular about
keeping his store and living rooms clean. He’s
right-down lazy.</p>

<p>Red was swishing the broom in the sitting room.
Suddenly he gave a yip.</p>

<p>“Lookit!” says he, holding up something in his
hand.</p>

<p>Scoop laughed.</p>

<p>“What’d you find?” says he. “A three-dollar
bill?”</p>

<p>“A black feather,” says Red.</p>

<p>That made the leader jump.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” says he, excited.</p>

<p>“It’s a parrot feather, too,” says Red. “I
picked it up on the floor.”</p>

<p>“Where there’s smoke there’s fire,” says Peg.
“And where there’s a black feather there’s a
feather duster.”</p>

<p>“Or a mino bird,” says I quickly.</p>

<p>We were sure now that the black parrot, as we
called it, was hidden in the store. And determined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
to find it, we went through the place from
top to bottom. We looked in all the cupboards.
We looked in the stuffy attic, too, and in the
drygoods boxes in the dark cellar. But we didn’t
find anything. I could see that Scoop was
stumped.</p>

<p>It came supper time and the Cap’n hadn’t come
home yet. So we fed the parrots some more
boiled corn and closed the store for the night.
There was an Indian medicine show on the public
square. We took it in, stopping at our old friend’s
store on our way home. But to our surprise he
wasn’t there.</p>

<p>Scoop had planned to stay all night with the
Cap’n to sort of watch for Mrs. Biggle’s parrot
in case it came to the bird store instead of going
back to the millinery store, as it was his idea that
our parrots might attract the stray one. And now
he begged us to keep him company. It wouldn’t
be any fun, he said, staying in the store all alone.
So I telephoned to Mother, to let her know where
I was, then we turned in, two of us sleeping in
the old man’s bed and the other two on a folding
couch in the sitting room.</p>

<p>Red and I had the couch. He’s a mean kid to
sleep with. He kicks like a mule. About the
time you get set in a nice cozy dream he cranks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
up his number eights and, bingo! you get a wallop
in the slats.</p>

<p>“Cut it out,” says I, growling, when he had
awakened me for the third time. “What do you
think this is?—a pile-driving contest?”</p>

<p>“Jerry,” says he in a hollow whisper, sort of
hanging to me in the dark, “I heard something.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” says I. “I heard my slats crack
when you rammed your foot into them. Have a
heart, kid. I ain’t made of cast-iron.”</p>

<p>“I heard a voice,” says he.</p>

<p>“It was me,” says I. “I was warbling canary
stuff in my sleep. I get that way from being in
the bird business.”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> don’t stutter,” says he.</p>

<p>I sat up then.</p>

<p>“Hey!” says I. “What’s that?”</p>

<p>“It was a stuttering voice,” says he.</p>

<p>“Probably Scoop and Peg,” says I. “They’re
trying to act funny with us and scare us.”</p>

<p>He shimmied around under the covers.</p>

<p>“Say, Jerry,” says he in a graveyard voice,
“don’t you feel scared?”</p>

<p>“Scared?” says I. “What is there to be scared
of?”</p>

<p>“I feel that way, kind of. Like something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
<em>spooky</em> was going to happen. Gee! Ain’t it
<em>dark</em>!”
</p>

<p>“Something <em>will</em> happen, all right,” says I, “if
you don’t dry up and let me go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“I don’t <em>think</em> it was a dream,” says he, sort
of checking up on his thoughts.</p>

<p>“What?” says I, yawning.</p>

<p>“The voice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, for the love of mud!”</p>

<p>“It said H-h-ham! H-h-ham!”</p>

<p>“Ham and eggs,” says I.</p>

<p>“No, just ‘H-h-ham!’ Like that. It was a
queer voice, too. Like some one choking.”</p>

<p>“You’re a cheerful guy to sleep with,” says I.
“Don’t you know any stories about ghosts or murders?
Let’s have a good one—one with a lot of
blood in it.”</p>

<p>“Jerry, there’s something queer about this
store.”</p>

<p>“Yah,” says I, “you’re in it.”</p>

<p>“About the Cap’n, I mean—putting that ad in
the newspaper, and everything. Wonder where
he is.”</p>

<p>“Fishing,” says I, with another yawn.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he come home?”</p>

<p>“Maybe a big bullhead bit his peg-leg off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
“Do you suppose he’s really got the stolen parrot
here?”</p>

<p>“You’ll have a real black eye,” says I, “if you
don’t dry up.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” says he, “it was the parrot I heard.”</p>

<p>I hooted.</p>

<p>“A stuttering parrot!” says I. “You’re good.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the other ducked under the covers
and tried to wind himself around me like a grapevine.</p>

<p>“<em>Jerry!</em> Did you hear it?”</p>

<p>The blamed calf! He had <em>me</em> scared, too.</p>

<p>“Hear what?” says I. And the rattle in my
back teeth sounded like a Ford on a rocky hill.</p>

<p>“The voice.”</p>

<p>I listened.</p>

<p>“H-h-ham!” came a voice in the darkness.
“H-h-ham!”</p>

<p>I got a grip on myself.</p>

<p>“I bet it’s Scoop and Peg,” says I. “I’m going
to get up and find out.”</p>

<p>“Oh!...” shimmied the grapevine, tightening
its hold on me. “Don’t get up.”</p>

<p>But I did. And going into the bedroom, I
found my two chums sound asleep.</p>

<p>“H-h-ham!” came the voice again, sort of low
and gasping-like. “H-h-ham! C-c-cut out his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
heart and f-f-fry it in butter. <a id="timetoeat"></a>It’s t-t-time to
e-e-eat.”</p>

<p>I was right-down scared now. There was something
spooky about that stuttering voice. Weird
is the word to use, I believe. And giving Scoop
and Peg a shake to wake them up, I told them to
pile out.</p>

<p>We got a hand lamp. And when the voice came
again we traced it to a large picture on the sitting room
wall. It was a picture of the dead sailor.
Remember that! We took the picture down.
There was a hole in the plastered wall. And in
the hole was a coal-black parrot in a wicker cage.</p>

<p>Besides being black all over, like a crow, it was
a funny-looking parrot. It was pretty big in its
body, with an awfully big curved bill. And it
had bleary eyes. That is, as we held the lamp
up to the hole the big black bird sort of leered
back at us as though it was half full of gin. You
know what I mean. And when it talked it weaved
back and forth like a drunken man. I began to
wonder what kind of a woman this Mrs. Strange
was, to bring up a parrot like this! It acted like
a barroom parrot to me.</p>

<p>As can be imagined, we were excited in the black
parrot’s discovery. And gathered around it, our
eyes fastened on it, we were kind of depressed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
too, in the knowledge that our old friend was indeed
a thief. We could not doubt that now. For
here was the stolen parrot in his home.</p>

<p>Peg had been studying the bird with puzzled
eyes.</p>

<p>“What do you call it?” says he.</p>

<p>“It’s a mino bird,” says Red.</p>

<p>The big one grunted.</p>

<p>“It looks like a common old parrot to me.”</p>

<p>“Parrots are green and yellow,” says Red, acting
as though he knew all about it. “And mino
birds are <em>black</em>. See?”</p>

<p>Peg loves to argue.</p>

<p>“Is a white hen a hen?” says he.</p>

<p>“Of course,” says Red.</p>

<p>“And what is a black hen?—a dickey bird?”</p>

<p>“It’s a hen,” says Red.</p>

<p>“Of course,” says Peg. “A hen’s a hen whether
it’s black or white or brown or green. And so is
this bird a parrot. The color doesn’t make any
difference in its name. It’s a <em>black parrot</em>. Get
me?”</p>

<p>“H-h-hello,” says the parrot, blinking at us in
the lamplight, its head cocked on one side.
“H-h-hello, you dirty b-b-bums.”</p>

<p>That tickled Red.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
“It’s looking at you, Peg. It’s got <em>your</em> number,
old hardhead.”</p>

<p>Scoop bent down.</p>

<p>“Hi, old shoe polish,” says he, grinning.</p>

<p>That set the parrot to laughing. Say, it could
laugh just as good as anybody. And it looked
funny, too, with its bleary, blinking eyes and
cocked head. Pretty soon we were laughing as
hard as it was.</p>

<p>We got it an apple. And all the while it was
eating the apple it kept blinking at us, sort of, and
saying funny things. It was a peachy parrot, all
right. We wished we owned it.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” we inquired.</p>

<p>“S-s-solomon.”</p>

<p>“King Solomon,” says Scoop, bowing.</p>

<p>“S-s-solomon Gu-gu-gu——” says the parrot,
stuttering to beat the cars.</p>

<p>“Look out there,” says Peg, laughing. “You’ll
gag yourself to death.”</p>

<p>“Gu-gu-gu——” says the parrot. It stopped
and turned around three times. “Gu-gu-gu——”</p>

<p>“Here,” says Peg, “have another apple.”</p>

<p>“Gu-gu-GRUNDY!” says the parrot, sort of
screeching out the full name. “S-s-solomon
Gu-gu——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
“Never mind,” says Peg. “We know you can
say it. So don’t kill yourself.”</p>

<p>That seemed to make the stutterer mad.</p>

<p>“H-h-ham!” it screeched. “H-h-ham! Put
’em in irons.”</p>

<p>Here the clock struck twelve. I don’t know
why it is, but when a clock strikes twelve at night
a fellow always thinks of ghosts. At least I do.
So you can imagine the scare I got when Red suddenly
let out an old gee-whacker of a scream.</p>

<p>“The window!” says he, pointing.</p>

<p>We looked quick. But we were too late to see
anything.</p>

<p>“What was it?” says Scoop, getting his voice.</p>

<p>“A man’s face.”</p>

<p>“Was it the old detective?”</p>

<p>“No-o,” says Red, shaking his head. “It
wasn’t him. First I saw a pair of eyes. Sort of
<em>burning</em> eyes. Then I saw the full face. It was
a man’s face. But it wasn’t the detective. I’m
sure of that.”</p>

<p>There was an alley along-side the bird store on
the west side. The sitting room had a door and
two windows opening into this alley. And it was
at one of these windows that Red had seen the
mysterious face.</p>

<p>As I say, I was scared stiff. I was kind of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
rattled, too. I get that way when I’m scared.
But I wasn’t so rattled but what I could put two
and two together and make four. The spy was
after the black parrot. I could see that, all right.</p>

<p>Scoop had tiptoed to the door.</p>

<p>“Listen!” says he, with his ear to the panel.</p>

<p>We could hear some one in the alley. Just outside
the door. And suddenly there was a scream.
Then we heard something fall.</p>

<p>“Let me in,” says a voice.</p>

<p>It was the Ott kid!</p>

<p>“What do you want?” says Scoop.</p>

<p>“My father has been hurt. Help me—<em>please</em>!”</p>

<p>When a kid is in trouble, and begs for help, you
can’t go back on him even if you have to run risks
in helping him. So we did what was right and
unlocked the door.</p>

<p>Our hand lamp made a puddle of light in the
alley. And there in front of the open door lay the
old detective. There was blood on his forehead.
He looked dead to me. I shivered at sight of him.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h3>
</div>

<h4>OUR NEW CHUM</h4>


<p>Well, there wasn’t any more sleep for us <em>that</em>
night. First of all we got the old detective into
the Cap’n’s bed. Then we sent a hurry-up call
for Doc Leland. But old Doc was out of town.
So we had to get busy and take care of the injured
man ourselves.</p>

<p>He was talking now. But it wasn’t sensible
talk. He didn’t know what he was saying or what
was going on around him. The whack that he
had gotten on the head had jammed his brain
wheels.</p>

<p>“Pretty birdie,” says he, sort of rambling-like,
a vacant look in his watery eyes. “Pretty birdie
in the treetop.”</p>

<p>Having done everything possible for the injured
man, Scoop screwed down the wick of the
bedroom lamp.</p>

<p>“Now,” says he to the patient, “close your eyes
and go to sleep. You’ll be all hunky-dory in the
morning. All you need is a little sleep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
“My haid,” says the old man, feeling of his
damaged upper story. “It hurts.”</p>

<p>“Keep your hands down,” says Scoop, taking
the pottering hands and putting them down.
“You mustn’t touch the bandage. For if you do
you’re liable to start the cut to bleeding again.”</p>

<p>“I can hear the birdies,” says the old man.</p>

<p>“Of course you can,” says Scoop. “There’re
nice birdies, too. And if you’ll lay still and listen
to them they’ll sing you to sleep.”</p>

<p>I was anxious to have a talk with the Ott kid.
For I figured he could clear up the mystery of the
spying face. So I was glad when Scoop signaled
to the kid to follow us into the sitting room.</p>

<p>“Now,” says the leader, giving the other one a
steady eye, “you can loosen up, if you will, and
tell us what you know about this.... Who did
it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” says the kid.</p>

<p>Scoop scowled.</p>

<p>“Come on, tell us the truth.”</p>

<p>“I <em>am</em> telling the truth.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence.</p>

<p>“Jerry and Red tell me,” says Scoop, “that
you’re all right. They say they’ve made friends
with you. But <em>I</em> don’t know whether we can trust
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
you or not. It looks to me as though you’re
covering up something.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t anything to cover up,” says the kid,
his eyes seeking the door of his father’s bedroom
in a troubled way.</p>

<p>“Were you and your father together in the
alley?”</p>

<p>“No. He was struck down before I got here.”</p>

<p>“But what was he doing here at this time of
night?”</p>

<p>“You ought to know.”</p>

<p>“Sleuthing?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“And were <em>you</em> sleuthing, too?”</p>

<p>“I followed Pa to town to look out for him,”
says the kid, flushing at Scoop’s sarcasm. “I
didn’t want him to get locked up. He gave me
the slip a block or two from here. Then I heard
a scream. I found him in the alley. And that’s
all I know.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t there any one else in the alley when
you got here?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“And you haven’t any idea who hit your
father?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The kid was telling the truth. I could see that.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
The leader could see it, too. And suddenly he
shoved out his hand.</p>

<p>“Shake,” says he. “If you’re a friend of my
pals, and they trust you, you’re my friend, too.”</p>

<p>“Ditto,” says Peg, getting in on the hand shaking.</p>

<p>The kid was uneasy.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose,” says he, watching the door
of his father’s room, “that Pa’ll be all right in
the morning, as you say?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” says Scoop. “It isn’t a bad cut.
He got hit with a club, I guess.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have happened,” says the kid,
after a moment, “if he had stayed at home to-night
as I wanted him to do. But he wouldn’t
listen to me. He never does.”</p>

<p>Scoop’s forehead was puckered.</p>

<p>“It puzzles me,” says he, “who hit your father,
and why.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it was the Cap’n,” says Peg.</p>

<p>“But why should the Cap’n come here on the
sly?” says I. “That doesn’t make sense to me.”</p>

<p>“He’s got a secret, Jerry. You know that.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says I, “and he’s got a temper, too.
And if he had seen us in here he would have made
short work of kicking us out.”</p>

<p>Scoop got a flashlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
“We can soon tell if it was the Cap’n,” says he.</p>

<p>We followed him outside. I kind of shivered
in the darkness. It was heavy. Like a black
blanket. The alley looked awfully spooky and
risky to me.</p>

<p>We found footprints under the window where
Red had seen the spying face. But we found no
prints of a peg-leg. So we knew the spy wasn’t
our queer old friend.</p>

<p>“Whoever it was,” says Scoop, “he saw us with
the black parrot. There’s no doubt about that.”</p>

<p>“What?” says the kid, staring. “Is the black
parrot <em>here</em>?”</p>

<p>“We discovered its hiding place about an hour
ago,” says Scoop. “The spy saw us feeding it.
That was just a minute or two before your father
was struck down.”</p>

<p>There was a bright look in the kid’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I can see what happened,” says he. “Pa surprised
the man at your window. See? And then
the man wheeled with a club.”</p>

<p>“I’d know the man,” says Red, “if I was to
see him again. For he had a mean face. Like a
killer.”</p>

<p>I shivered.</p>

<p>“For the love of mud!” says I, trying to cut the
darkness with my eyes. “Shut up and stay shut.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
You give a fellow the creeps. A killer! Br-r-r-r!
Let’s go inside.”</p>

<p>We were pretty well acquainted with the new
kid now. And we started calling him Poppy.</p>

<p>“I like that name,” says he, “better than my
real name.”</p>

<p>“What is your real name?” says Scoop.</p>

<p>“I hate to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Is it worse than Poppy?”</p>

<p>“<em>Is</em> it! Nicholas Carter Sherlock Holmes
Ott. How do you like that?”</p>

<p>“<em>Good</em> night!” says Scoop. “Who gave you
that name?—some half-baked librarian?”</p>

<p>The kid laughed.</p>

<p>“My father named me after his two favorite
detective heroes. But just forget about the name.
I don’t tell it to everybody. Poppy suits me
better, as I say. The Cedarburg kids gave me
that nickname because I peddled popcorn.”</p>

<p>Scoop grinned.</p>

<p>“In <em>this</em> gang,” says he, joking, “we stand by
each other and use each other right. So you’ve
got our promise never to disgrace you in public
by calling you by your real name. From now on
you’re Poppy Ott to us. And we’ll just forget
that you ever had any other name.”</p>

<p>“You tell ’em,” says Peg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
“And now,” says the leader, “let’s get down to
business. For, as I see it, we’ve got a real job
ahead of us in solving this parrot mystery. Here’s
the dope. The Cap’n has a stolen parrot in his
house. Maybe <em>he</em> stole the parrot; maybe some
one else stole it. Anyway, as I say, the parrot is
here. But before we turn it over to the law, to
be returned to its rightful owner, I’d like to have
a day or two to dig into this thing. For instance,
who is the spy? What’s he after? Is it the black
parrot? Does the Cap’n know about the spy?
Is that why he has been hiding the parrot? You
can see what we’re up against. There’s a lots
bigger mystery here than we thought. And if
something <em>dark</em> is piling up around the Cap’n—something
that is liable to harm him, I mean—and
he’s innocent, I think we ought to stand by
him and help him.”</p>

<p>“He’s got the stolen parrot,” says I. “We
know that. So how can he be innocent?”</p>

<p>Scoop nodded, grave-like.</p>

<p>“You’re right, Jerry,” says he. “It does look
as though the Cap’n is behind the stealing. But
I’m going to give him a chance to clear himself.
And if he <em>can’t</em> do that ... well, then, Poppy,
we’ll let your pa have the parrot. And if the
law steps in on the Cap’n to punish him he’ll have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
to take his medicine. For it isn’t my scheme to
shield him if he’s guilty. Not so you can notice
it.”</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to feel ashamed of myself,”
says Poppy, with a gentle look toward the bedroom.
“I thought Pa was an old dumb-bell in
his detecting. But if he gets this thousand dollars
I’ll have to admit that he’s pretty smart.”</p>

<p>“The thousand dollars,” says I, glad in the
thought, “will set you up in a good home.”</p>

<p>“It seems almost too good to be true,” says
Poppy, his eyes shining. “A thousand dollars!
I’m beginning to feel proud of Pa, kind of.”</p>

<p>Red laughed in the sudden turn of his thoughts.</p>

<p>“Say,” says he, “what did your pa say about
the broken wagon wheels?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” says Poppy, “he got mad and jawed
around. But he shut up when <em>I</em> got mad worse.
I told him what was what. The old wagon was
going to stay right here, I said. I told him if
he put any more wheels on it I’d smash <em>them</em> to
pieces, too.”</p>

<p>“You won’t have to live in the wagon,” says I,
“when you get the thousand dollars. For then
you can rent a regular house.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind living in the wagon,” says he.
“What I don’t like is being a tramp.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
Peg laughed.</p>

<p>“We’ll help you put a foundation under the
wagon and fix it up swell.”</p>

<p>“Hot dog!” says I. “That will be fun.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll put out a sign,” says Scoop in nonsense.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>PRIVATE DETECTIVE</i><br>
<br>
Whatever your mystery<br>
You’ll have it not<br>
If you bring it to<br>
Horatio Calabash Ott.<br>
</p>

<p>Poppy couldn’t see anything funny in that.</p>

<p>“No,” says he, shaking his head. “I don’t
want you to put out a detective sign. I want Pa
to quit his foolish detecting and do something
useful.”</p>

<p>“But he’s making money,” says I, thinking of
the thousand dollars.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t got the money yet,” says Poppy.
“And even if he does get it I have a hunch that
this will be his first and last successful case. Luck
was with him this trip.”</p>

<p>We had put the black parrot back in its wall
hole before unlocking the alley door. And now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
we brought the bird out. At sight of it Poppy
gave a queer cry.</p>

<p>“I knew it was too good to be true,” says he,
acting as though the world had dropped from
under him.</p>

<p>Scoop caught his breath.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” says he quickly.</p>

<p>“Pa’ll never get a thousand dollars for <em>that</em>
bird. For it’s a real parrot—can’t you see? It’s
a coal-black parrot. It isn’t the stolen mino bird
at all.”</p>

<p>Peg was in his glory.</p>

<p>“What’d I tell you?” says he to Red, acting
superior.</p>

<p>Scoop’s eyes were fastened on the black bird.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” says he at length. “If
this isn’t the stolen bird, what bird is it?”</p>

<p>“S-s-solomon Gu-gu-gu——” says the parrot,
cocking its funny eyes at us.</p>

<p>“It’s trying to tell you who it is,” says I, laughing.</p>

<p>“Gu-gu-gu——” says the parrot. Then it
whistled. “Gu-gu-GRUNDY. Solomon Gu-gu-GRUNDY.
Nice Solomon Gu-gu-GRUNDY.
Gu-gu-give me a k-k-kiss.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Red,” says I, “and let it smack
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
“And get a hunk bit out of my nose!” says the
freckled one, scowling at me. “What do you take
me for?—a pumpkin?”</p>

<p>“K-k-kiss the c-c-cook,” says the parrot. “K-k-kiss
the cook and t-t-tickle her back with a p-p-poker.
When do we e-e-eat? Gu-gu-give me
some blood. I k-k-killed him! I k-k-killed him!
Gu-gu-give me a bucket of blood. I like blood.
Gu-gu-give me a bucket of blood.”</p>

<p>Scoop shook his head.</p>

<p>“We’re finding out secrets,” says he, with a
queer laugh. “But I’ll be blamed if I know what
it’s all about.”</p>

<p>Peg bent over the leering parrot.</p>

<p>“Say,” says he, in a steady voice, “who did you
kill, anyway? Tell us.”</p>

<p>“H-h-ham,” says the parrot, sort of dull and
rasping-like. “H-h-ham. I killed H-h-ham.
Blood. Gu-gu-give me some blood.”</p>

<h4>OLD CALEB’S QUEER STORY</h4>


<p>I’ve got a pretty good head on me. In solving
mysteries I can think things out pretty good. Still
there are times when my mind goes jumpy. If a
mystery takes a sudden surprising turn I get excited.
I was that way now.</p>

<p>The stuttering parrot’s “blood” talk had befuddled
me. Like Scoop, I couldn’t make sense
of it. And I was disappointed, too, in the thought
that now Poppy Ott’s father would lose out on
the thousand-dollar reward that the Cedarburg
woman had offered for the return of her stolen
mino bird. I had wanted Mr. Ott to get the
thousand dollars so that Poppy could have a good
home like the rest of us. But if this bird of the
Cap’n wasn’t the stolen mino bird—if, instead, it
was a real black parrot, as Poppy declared—it
was a cinch that the old detective wouldn’t be able
to turn it in for the big reward.</p>

<p>Our new chum looked sort of crushed.</p>

<p>“Poor Pa,” says he. “It’ll pretty nearly flatten
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
him out when he learns that he has been trailing
the wrong parrot. It’ll be an awful blow to him.”</p>

<p>As I say, we didn’t go back to bed that night.
We were too excited to be sleepy. At daybreak
we were still talking about the mystery. Going
outside, we searched the alley. But we found no
clews.</p>

<p>Mr. Ott got up at six o’clock. He was all
right now, only his head ached. At first he was
suspicious of us and snapped us up when we tried
to quiz him. But Poppy made him understand
that we were his friends.</p>

<p>To our disappointment the old man couldn’t
tell us very much about the spy.</p>

<p>“It was a man, a’ average-sized man, an’ that’s
all I know,” says he. “I seed him at the windy.
He was lookin’ inside. I got up behind him to
show him my star an’ arrest him on suspicion.
An’ then he turned quick-like an’ hit me on the
haid with a club.”</p>

<p>“Did he say anything to you?” says Scoop.</p>

<p>“No, he jest turned quick an’ hit me.”</p>

<p>“And you didn’t see his face?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Nothing was said to the old detective about the
stuttering parrot. In planning things Scoop had
asked Poppy not to tell his father about the hidden
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
parrot until we had had a chance to talk with
the Cap’n. For the hidden parrot was the Cap’n’s
secret. And we had no right to peddle the secret
without our old friend’s permission.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, Poppy started off with his
father, then came back.</p>

<p>“I want to thank you fellows,” says he earnestly,
“for taking me into your gang. I don’t
look like much. But you won’t be sorry you
picked me up, I can tell you that much.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you take your pa home and come back?”
Scoop invited. “You can help us solve the mystery.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to look for a job.”</p>

<p>Red is a dumb-bell in blurting out things.</p>

<p>“Before you start looking for a job,” says he,
“you better go home and put on your Sunday
clothes.”</p>

<p>Poppy’s face reddened.</p>

<p>“<em>These</em> are my Sunday clothes,” says he, looking
down at himself. “And they’re my Monday
clothes and my Tuesday clothes, too.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a lot of clothes at home,” says I
quickly. “And if you’ll let me, I’ll take you home
and fix you up. For, as Red says, you’ll stand
a better chance of getting a good job if you look
neat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
“I’ll be back,” says he.</p>

<p>The Cap’n didn’t come home to breakfast.
That puzzled us. And then, to our surprise, old
Caleb Obed came around for his regular morning
checker game.</p>

<p>Scoop stared at the pottering newcomer.</p>

<p>“I thought you and the Cap’n had gone fishing,”
says he.</p>

<p>“<em>Me?</em>” says old Caleb, cocking his glass eye at
us. “<em>Me</em> an’ the Cap’n, you say? No, sir, it
wasn’t <em>me</em> an’ the Cap’n—it was jest the Cap’n,
himself.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t home yet,” says Scoop.</p>

<p>“Um ...” says old Caleb, waggling. “Skeered
to come home, he be. That’s what’s keepin’
him away. He’s skeered that I’ll up an’ beat him
like I did yesterday. I guess he knows <em>now</em> who’s
the best checker player in this town. I showed
him up yesterday, I did. Seven games it was, an’
I beat him every one. <em>He</em> didn’t git a game even.”</p>

<p>Scoop winked at us as a signal for us to keep
still and let him do the talking.</p>

<p>“Say, Caleb,” says he, “do you happen to know
what the Cap’n feeds his black parrot for breakfast?”</p>

<p>Old Caleb’s jaw dropped.</p>

<p>“Heh?” says he, staring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
“I suppose we ought to take good care of the
parrot,” says Scoop, “until the old man gets
home.”</p>

<p>Caleb’s face was full of suspicion now.</p>

<p>“How come,” says he, with narrowed eyes,
“that you-all know ’bout that pesky par’ot? I
thought it was a secret.”</p>

<p>Scoop grinned.</p>

<p>“Some parrot, isn’t it, Caleb? It’s the first
stuttering parrot I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says the old man, in a sudden talkative
streak, “an’ it’s the only <em>black</em> par’ot in the whole
world. Ham Tinkertop could ’a’ sold it fur a lot
of money, I guess, it bein’ a freak. But, no, sir,
he wouldn’t let it go. He had a reason fur keepin’
it. I heerd him talkin’ ’bout it to the Cap’n the
last time he was here, which was the summer the
Cap’n got stuck in the rat hole in his kitchen floor
with his peg-leg and had to be sawed out. ‘Boaz,’
says Ham to his brother, only he didn’t say it jest
like that, fur you know what a awful stutterer
he was, ‘Boaz,’ says he, ‘strange as it may seem
to you, knowin’ what you do ’bout Solomon
Grundy, they hain’t a man in the world outside of
yourself that I think as much of as I do of that
thar par’ot. That’s a fact. An’ if you’ll give him
a good hum when I’m daid an’ gone, with no ill
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
feelin’ ’gainst him fur what you know ’bout him—only
keepin’ a sharp eye on him, of course, so he
won’t do nobody any damage—if you’ll do that,
Boaz,’ says Ham to the Cap’n, with me a-listenin’
in, like I say, ‘I’ll promise to make over my life
insurance money to you.’”</p>

<p>Scoop gave us another wink.</p>

<p>“I’ve often wondered,” says he to the talkative
one, “how much money the Cap’n brought home
from his brother’s funeral.”</p>

<p>“Two thousand dollars,” says old Caleb
promptly. “I was with him the day he put the
insurance money in the bank.”</p>

<p>Scoop laughed.</p>

<p>“Gee! I wish some one would will <em>me</em> two
thousand dollars for taking care of a parrot. The
Cap’n’s lucky.”</p>

<p>A queer look flashed into the old man’s
wrinkled face.</p>

<p>“Um.... Mebbe the Cap’n’s lucky. An’
mebbe he ben’t.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” says Scoop
quickly.</p>

<p>The old man started for the door.</p>

<p>“I come here to play checkers,” says he, snappish-like,
“an’ not to tell secrets.” He paused in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
the doorway, his beady eyes hidden under shaggy
brows. “But let me give you young fellers a
pointer,” he added. “Don’t you git too clost to
that thar par’ot. It <em>acts</em> all right; an’ you <em>think</em>
it’s all right. But it’ll nab you in a minute if it
gits a chance. An’ if that happens you’re a-goin’
to be sorry, I kin tell you that much.”</p>

<p>“Well,” says Scoop, when the old gossip had
taken himself away, “I guess we know now where
the parrot and the money came from.”</p>

<p>“And we know why the parrot stutters,” says
I, thinking of the Cap’n’s stuttering brother, who
undoubtedly had taught the bird to speak.</p>

<p>“It’s a disappointment to me,” says Scoop,
“that there isn’t some connection between this
bird and the stolen mino bird. I had hoped for
a lot of mystery.”</p>

<p>“How about the man at the window?” says I.
“<em>He’s</em> a mystery.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” says Red.</p>

<p>“I wonder who he is,” says Scoop, thinking.</p>

<p>“And <em>I</em> wonder,” says Peg, “what old Caleb
meant by that queer talk of his. You could think
from his warning that the stuttering parrot was
some kind of a peril.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the parrot has a bad disease,” says I.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
“Maybe that is why the Cap’n has been hiding it.”</p>

<p>“If it has a harmful disease,” says Scoop, “it
ought to be killed.”</p>

<p>“But the Cap’n was paid two thousand dollars
for taking care of it. See? He doesn’t dare to
kill it.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, as though it knew what we were talking
about, the black parrot lifted its voice in its
wall hole.</p>

<p>“B-b-blood! B-b-blood! Give me some b-b-blood!”</p>

<h4>UP THE CREEK</h4>


<p>Poppy came along about nine o’clock. And I
noticed right away that he had been in the creek.
I didn’t say anything about it, though. I thought
it might not be polite for me to let on to him that
I noticed any change in him. But I was glad that
he had washed himself. I knew that Mother
would like him better now.</p>

<p>Scoop and Red were out parrot hunting. And
leaving Peg to run the store, Poppy and I hurried
down the street. Pretty soon we came to our
house. Mother was baking cookies.</p>

<p>“This is Poppy Ott,” says I, introducing my
new chum.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to know you, Poppy,” says Mother,
giving the new acquaintance a warm handshake.
“Have a cookie,” says she.</p>

<p>“I brought Poppy home with me,” says I, “to
try some of my old clothes on him.”</p>

<p>Mother caught on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
“Fine!” says she, in her usual generous way.
“I was wondering the other day what we’d do with
that brown corduroy suit of yours. It’s perfectly
good. And you never wear it.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” says Poppy, when we were in my bedroom.
“You’ve got a swell mother.”</p>

<p>“And I’ve got a swell dad, too,” says I. “Wait
until you meet him.”</p>

<p>“Did you say he runs a brickyard?”</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’ll give Pa a job,” says Poppy.</p>

<p>“He hires a lot of men,” says I.</p>

<p>“I want Pa to work at something useful,” says
Poppy, “and quit his silly detecting. I’ve tried
to get him to go to work before, but he wouldn’t.
But he’s got to go to work this time. I’ve made
up my mind to that.”</p>

<p>“Here,” says I, bringing out the suit that
Mother had mentioned, “jump into this and we’ll
go over to the brickyard and see Dad.”</p>

<p>Poppy looked like a million dollars in good
clothes. My suit fitted him swell. I gave him a
shirt, too, and a necktie and some stockings and
shoes. To finish off I slipped him a cap and the
price of a haircut.</p>

<p>“You’re the best friend I ever had, Jerry,”
says he, when we came out of the barber shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
“And we’re going to keep on being friends,”
says I, feeling good in what I had done.</p>

<p>“Forever and ever,” says he earnestly.</p>

<p>We met Red on our way to the brickyard. He
hadn’t seen anything of his aunt’s parrot, he said.
While we were talking about the escaped parrot a
gang of boys our age came into sight from Zulutown,
which is the name that the Tutter people
have for the tough end of town where Cap’n
Tinkertop used to live.</p>

<p>“Step this way, folks,” says the gang’s smart
leader, letting on that he was a showman, “and
see Dumb-bell, the red-headed baboon, who picks
his teeth with a crowbar and walks a clothesline
on his hind legs just like a human bein’.”</p>

<p>This wasn’t the first time that Bid Stricker and
his gang of roughnecks had called our freckled
chum a baboon. And I didn’t blame poor Red
for getting huffy. For a fellow can’t help his
looks. If he had red hair and freckles he was
made that way in heaven.</p>

<p>“Lookit!” says Jimmy Stricker, Bid’s mean
cousin. “They’ve got a new kid in the gang.
Let’s initiate him with a brick.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?” says Poppy, getting my eye.</p>

<p>“The Zulutown gang,” says I.</p>

<p>“They don’t act like friends of yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
“<em>Friends!</em>” says I, turning up my nose at the
smart Alecks. “I should hope not. They hate
us because we’re smarter than they are. And
every chance they get they pick on us.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Poppy,” says Bid, sneering-like. “We
know <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“The kid tramp!” says Jimmy. “Isn’t he cunning
in Jerry’s old suit.”</p>

<p>“Where’s your ‘Charley Chaplin’ pants,
trampy?” says Bid.</p>

<p>Poppy turned to me again.</p>

<p>“Do you care,” says he, quiet-like, “if I go over
there and knock their blocks off?”</p>

<p>“It’s five to three,” says I.</p>

<p>“You and Red take one apiece,” says he, “and
I’ll take the other three.”</p>

<p>The cowardly enemy beat it into Zulutown when
we took after them. And putting them out of our
thoughts, we separated, Red going in search of
Scoop while Poppy and I headed for the brickyard
office where Dad was.</p>

<p>It was my Grandfather Todd who started the
Tutter Vitrified Brick Company. That was in
1884. When he died the business became Dad’s.
Some day, I suppose, when I get to using a safety
razor three times a week, I’ll be a partner in the
business. It’s going to be fun being a partner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
of Dad’s. We found my future partner dictating
letters to his secretary, Miss Tubbs.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Jerry,” says he, acting glad to see me.
Then he grinned at Poppy. “Who’s your
friend?” says he, joking. “Some influential brick
buyer?”</p>

<p>I told him who Poppy was.</p>

<p>“He’s going to live in Tutter,” says I, “and
go to school here. And we want to get his father
a job in the brickyard.”</p>

<p>“Um ...” says Dad, thinking. “I can’t recall
any detecting jobs that we have open right
now.... How old is your father?”</p>

<p>“Sixty-two,” says Poppy.</p>

<p>“Too old to push a truck,” says Dad, shaking
his head. “But if he’s dependable I might be able
to use him as a night watchman. For Denny
Corbin quit me last night. Suppose you send the
old gentleman around this afternoon so I can
have a talk with him.”</p>

<p>When we were in the street Poppy said that
things were coming his way fast. He had a home
that wasn’t on wheels, he said. And he had good
clothes and good friends.</p>

<p>“I only hope,” says he, “that Pa won’t do something
silly on his new job and lose it.”</p>

<p>“Dad’ll be patient with him,” says I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
“Your dad’s swell, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“<em>Your</em> dad is going to be swell, too,” says I,
“when we get through with him.”</p>

<p>In that moment Poppy’s eyes seemed to see
things a thousand miles away.</p>

<p>“I only wish Ma was alive,” says he, dreamy-like.</p>

<p>It was on the end of my tongue to tell him that
we would get a new ma for him. But I checked
myself. He might not like that, I thought. Still,
it was a thing to keep in mind, I told myself. I
had heard it said by older people that it takes a
good wife to keep a man steady. We wanted to
keep Mr. Ott steady. And it might be, I told
myself, that a new wife was the very thing he
needed.</p>

<p>At the store Peg told us that he had had a long distance
telephone call from the Cap’n.</p>

<p>“The old dumb-bell! What do you know if
he didn’t go to sleep in his fishing boat last night
and float down the Illinois River. He woke up
down at Oglesby. Now he’s rowing back.”</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>“Where did you say he woke up?”</p>

<p>“Down at Oglesby.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that anybody ever woke up
down there,” says I, in nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
Later on Scoop and Red dragged themselves
into the store empty-handed.</p>

<p>“Good-by parrot,” says the leader, dropping
wearily onto the counter.</p>

<p>Red swabbed his face.</p>

<p>“Let’s go swimming,” says he. “I’m about
melted.”</p>

<p>Locking the doors, and posting a notice that
the store would be open again at one o’clock, we
headed out of town on the Treebury pike, going
up the Happy Hollow road past the Scotch
cemetery.</p>

<p>“Lookit!” says Scoop, pointing over the cemetery
fence. “They’re digging a grave.”</p>

<p>“What of it?” says I. “Graves don’t interest
me.”</p>

<p>“But they’re digging <em>this</em> grave in Cap’n
Tinkertop’s lot.”</p>

<p>Red laughed at his thoughts.</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re going to bury the Cap’n’s
wooden leg,” says he.</p>

<p>“I’d sooner think,” says Scoop, thoughtful-like,
“that they were planning to bury the dead
sailor.”</p>

<p>“But <em>he</em> was buried over in Cedarburg,” says I.</p>

<p>“They can dig a man up and bury him twice,
can’t they?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
“You’re crazy,” says I.</p>

<p>In the time that we were dressing after our
swim Peg and Red got into an argument over the
escaped parrot. It was fun to listen to them talk.
For Red gets hot-headed when he tries to argue.</p>

<p>“What?” says Peg, turning up his nose. “Do
you mean to call that ordinary hunk of green
feathers that your aunt buys crackers for a
<em>parrot</em>? Boy, you don’t know what a real parrot
is. Take Solomon Grundy. Um ... there’s
a parrot worth owning, let me tell you.”</p>

<p>“My aunt’s parrot can lick it,” says Red, strutting
around like a bantam rooster.</p>

<p>Peg hooted at that.</p>

<p>“Your aunt’s parrot!” says he. “Go on! Your
aunt hasn’t got a parrot. All she’s got is an empty
bird cage.”</p>

<p>“I can catch her parrot,” says Red, bragging
reckless-like.</p>

<p>“Yah,” says Peg, “and you can catch cold, too.”</p>

<p>The freckled one was on his high horse now.</p>

<p>“Here’s my jackknife,” says he, slamming the
knife down, “and here’s a jaw breaker and here’s
a shooter and a box of fishhooks. Now, wise guy,
I’ll bet you the whole caboodle that my parrot can
lick your parrot. Put up or shut up.”</p>

<p>Peg hooked the piece of candy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
“Um-yum!” says he, smacking.</p>

<p>Red looked silly. He saw now that Peg had
been arguing in fun. As for old hefty, he was in
his glory. He likes to get Red’s goat. And he
has learned from experience that the easiest and
surest way to tease the smaller one is to argue
with him about his stuff or his family’s stuff. For
Red has the conceited idea that whatever stuff the
Meyers family owns is the best stuff of its kind in
the world.</p>

<p>Poppy hadn’t been with us up the creek. And
on our way home we met him in the road.</p>

<p>“I’ve got something for you,” says he, grinning.
And what do you know if he didn’t pull the lost
parrot out of his coat.</p>

<p>“Hot dog!” says Red.</p>

<p>“I found it in the willows,” says Poppy.</p>

<p>Taking the parrot, Red fell behind with Peg.
We could hear the two of them whispering and
giggling together, the best of pals again. Coming
into town, Scoop and Peg turned south on Grove
Street and Red and I went on alone.</p>

<p>“What’s eating you?” says I, when the freckled
one kept on giggling.</p>

<p>“Oh,” says he, acting big, “Peg and I know
something.”</p>

<p>And that is all I could get out of him.</p>

<h4>FOUR WHEELBARROWS</h4>


<p>“Jerry,” Mother told me, when I tumbled into
the kitchen where she was mashing the potatoes
for dinner, “there’s a note for you on the
Victrola.”</p>

<p>“Who from?” says I.</p>

<p>“Mr. Caleb Obed,” says she.</p>

<p>I was surprised.</p>

<p>“What’s the old man writing to me for?” says
I.</p>

<p>“It’s about a wheelbarrow,” says she.</p>

<p>I got the note. Here it is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span>: I just got word from Cap’n Tinkertop
and he wants you to meet him at the river
bridge at two o’clock with a wheelbarrow.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Caleb Obed.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Here Dad came into the kitchen and started
fooling around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
“The Cap’n must be on his way home with a
boatload of bullheads,” says he, when he had
read the note.</p>

<p>Mother laughed.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” says she, “the old man is tired from
his long row and wants Jerry to wheel him home
in style.”</p>

<p>I was looking at the note.</p>

<p>“We haven’t got a wheelbarrow,” says I.</p>

<p>“Sure thing we have,” says Dad. “Look in
the garage behind the old porch screens.”</p>

<p>When dinner was over I got the wheelbarrow
and started out. It was a mile to the river. And
I can’t say that I was very crazy over my job.
But I didn’t back down on account of the hot
sun. I didn’t want to disappoint the Cap’n.
We’re good friends and he does things for me.
Besides I wanted to find out the truth about the
stuttering parrot. And I figured it would help
me if I were to get on the good side of him. He
would tell me more then.</p>

<p>I couldn’t figure out, though, why the old man
wanted me to meet him at the river bridge with a
wheelbarrow. Certainly it wasn’t to bring home
a big catch of bullheads, as Dad had said in fun.
Could it be, I asked myself, that there was some
mystery back of his note?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
Red was ahead of me in River Street. I got my
eyes on his bow legs. And when I got closer to
him I saw in surprise that he was trundling a
wheelbarrow like mine.</p>

<p>“It’s for the Cap’n,” says he, when I overtook
him. “He had old Caleb Obed write me a note
to meet him at the river bridge.”</p>

<p>“Old Caleb wrote me a note, too,” says I.</p>

<p>“Good night!” says Red, staring at my wheelbarrow.
“The old man must be bringing home a
ton of coal.”</p>

<p>We had a good sweat in our walk in the hot
sun. Coming to the river bridge, we saw old Caleb
fishing over the railing. Peg was there, too. And
what do you know if our chum didn’t have a
wheelbarrow as big as Red’s and mine put together.</p>

<p>Old Caleb was shaking his shaggy head and
talking in a loud voice.</p>

<p>“No,” says he, “I didn’t write you no note ’bout
a wheelbarrow. I don’t know what you’re talkin’
’bout.”</p>

<p>Peg showed how he could scowl.</p>

<p>“How about this?” says he, shoving a piece of
paper under the old man’s nose. “It’s got your
name on it.”</p>

<p>“Um.... Let me see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
“Right there,” says Peg, jabbing with his
finger.</p>

<p>In the time that the near-sighted one was fumbling
around for his spectacles we heard Scoop
coming down the river road. He was whistling
and stepping it off as big as cuffy.</p>

<p>“Lookit!” says Red, sort of squeaky-like, grabbing
my arm and pointing to the newcomer.</p>

<p>“Another wheelbarrow!” says I, going dizzy.</p>

<p>“It’s kind of wabbly,” says Scoop, when he had
joined us, “but it’s the only one in our block that
I could find.” Here his gab trailed away in a
sudden discovery. “What in Sam Hill?...”
says he, blinking. “Four wheelbarrows! Is it
an epidemic?”</p>

<p>Here a row of monkey faces was lifted into
sight out of the weeds.</p>

<p>“Haw! haw! haw!” says Bid Stricker, jeering-like.</p>

<p>I saw then where the notes had come from.
And did I ever feel cheap! To let a dumb-bell
like Bid Stricker fool us this way! <em>Good</em> night!</p>

<p>We took after the smart Alecks, running them
into town. But we couldn’t catch them.</p>

<p>Old Caleb was cackling to himself when we
came back to the bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
“Heh! heh! heh!” says he, shaking all over.
“They fooled you slick, didn’t they?”</p>

<p>“Wait and see what <em>they</em> get,” says Scoop, mopping
his face and glaring in the direction of town
where we could see the enemy kicking up dust in
the river road.</p>

<p>“You’re goin’ to git back at ’em, hey?”</p>

<p>“<em>Are</em> we?”</p>

<p>Peg grunted.</p>

<p>“I’d like to punch Bid Stricker in the snout.”</p>

<p>“You take Bid,” says I, “and I’ll take Jimmy.”</p>

<p>Scoop laughed.</p>

<p>“Do you know what <em>I’m</em> going to do,” says he.</p>

<p>“What?” says Peg.</p>

<p>“I’m going to think up a snappy trick to play
on them. That’ll be more fun than beating them
up.”</p>

<p>“Hot dog!” says I, looking ahead to fun.</p>

<p>Yes, I was full of giggles. For I knew how
smart Scoop was in thinking up tricks. But I
guess I would have been full of shivers, instead,
if I had known what we were heading into. In
the trick that we later prepared for the Strickers
I got the worst of it. Br-r-r-r! I don’t like to
think about it. And to this day I always tremble
when I go into a dark cellar. I expect to touch
something <em>cold</em>.</p>

<h4>THE ESCAPED PARROT</h4>


<p>As I say, old Caleb Obed and the Cap’n are
pretty thick. What one knows the other knows.
They’re that way. They jangle like a couple of
silly kids in playing checkers. But in other ways
they’re the closest of friends.</p>

<p>Now old Caleb got the idea in his head that we
were neglecting his friend’s bird business. And
he started jawing at us.</p>

<p>“I might ’a’ knowed,” says he, scowling at us,
“that you b’ys wouldn’t tend to business. Here
you be traipsin’ ’round the country with four
wheelbarrows an’ the store locked up. When the
Cap’n gits home I’m a-goin’ to tell him ’bout this.”</p>

<p>Scoop got mad.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” says he. “We should worry what
you tell him. If he doesn’t like the way we run
the store he can stay home and run it himself.”</p>

<p>“I’m a-goin’ back to town,” says Old Caleb,
pulling in his fishing line. “I hain’t a-goin’ to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
see my ol’ friend’s business go to pot. No, sir.
I’ll jest run it myself till he gits home.”</p>

<p>“Help yourself,” says Scoop. “We don’t get
anything out of it, anyway.... Come on,
gang.”</p>

<p>“What are we going to do with the wheelbarrows?”
says I.</p>

<p>The leader grinned.</p>

<p>“We might have a parade,” says he, “and
wheel ’em into town.”</p>

<p>“Yah,” says I, “and have the Strickers hoot at
us. Nothin’ doin’,” and I dumped my wheelbarrow
into the weeds.</p>

<p>The other fellows followed my example. Then
we set out for town.</p>

<p>Red and Peg, I noticed, had their heads together
in more whispered secrets.</p>

<p>“What’s eating you guys?” says Scoop, watching
the others.</p>

<p>“Ask Red,” says Peg.</p>

<p>“Ask Peg,” says Red.</p>

<p>The leader got huffy at the gigglers.</p>

<p>“Come on, Jerry,” says he, pulling me aside.
“We don’t have to hang around with them if they
don’t want us to.”</p>

<p>“What’s the idea of getting sore at them?”
says I, when we were alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
He gave me a hidden grin.</p>

<p>“I’m not sore,” says he. “I’m just letting on.
Don’t you catch on, Jerry? They’re going to
have a parrot fight.”</p>

<p>“Hot dog!” says I.</p>

<p>“It’ll be ‘dead dog’ for them,” says he, laughing,
“if the Cap’n comes home and finds black
parrot feathers scattered all over his house. For
you know the old man’s temper.”</p>

<p>“There they go,” says I, pointing to the gigglers,
who had hurried away from us. “They’re
heading for the store.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get into the Cap’n’s attic,” says Scoop,
“and watch them through the trapdoor in the
sitting-room ceiling. That’ll be fun, for they
won’t know we’re there. And when the show is
over we’ll give them the horselaugh.”</p>

<p>The other two stopped in a candy store, so we
managed to get ahead of them. At the bird store
we went up a fire escape to the flat roof.</p>

<p>“The Cap’n doesn’t know it,” says Scoop, raising
a scuttle, “but last week when he was away
to the county fair I lost the front-door key and
had to get into the store this way.”</p>

<p>The attic that we dropped into was stuffy and
dusty. I got cobwebs in my teeth. I hate spiders.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
And I shivered in the thought of swallowing one
of the nasty things.</p>

<p>Scoop raised the trapdoor in the sitting-room
ceiling.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” says he.</p>

<p>The parrot heard us.</p>

<p>“Why does it keep calling for Ham?” says
Scoop.</p>

<p>“That was the name of its master,” says I,
thinking of the dead sailor.</p>

<p>“I know that,” says Scoop. “But now that
the man is dead I should think the bird would
forget about him.”</p>

<p>“I k-k-killed him!” came from the parrot in a
shrill, screechy voice. “I k-k-killed him! B-b-blood!
B-b-blood! Gu-gu-give me some b-b-blood!”</p>

<p>Scoop shook his head.</p>

<p>“If <em>we</em> only knew what that parrot knows,”
says he.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“It has a secret, Jerry. This ‘blood’ talk isn’t
mere chatter. There’s a meaning back of it.”</p>

<p>The parrot was still talking when Peg and Red
appeared at the alley door.</p>

<p>“Nobody at home,” says Peg, coming into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
room below us, “except Solomon Grundy and the
parlor lamp.”</p>

<p>Red had his aunt’s parrot in a shoe box.</p>

<p>“My bird’s ready,” says he, strutting around,
“whenever yours is.”</p>

<p>Peg heaved across the room to the hidden wall
hole.</p>

<p>“Howdy, King Solomon,” says he, taking down
the picture that hid the hole.</p>

<p>The parrot bristled in its cage.</p>

<p>“Gu-gu-git out, you dirty b-b-bums.”</p>

<p>The big one laughed.</p>

<p>“Hey!” says he. “Don’t you talk that way to
me, you hunk of petrified ink, or I’ll bite your
cupola off.”</p>

<p>“H-h-ham!” says the parrot, screechy-like.
“R-r-rattle their skulls, H-h-ham. R-r-rattle their
skulls.”</p>

<p>This brought the other parrot to life.</p>

<p>“Breakfast,” came a thin voice from the shoe
box. “Polly wants breakfast.”</p>

<p>Peg laughed.</p>

<p>“Polly will want a casket pretty quick,” says
he.</p>

<p>“Don’t kid yourself,” says Red, sleuthing the
table edge for a wad of chewing gum that he had
parked there earlier in the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
“Your parrot sounds like a hunk of cake,” says
Peg.</p>

<p>“Cake with rat poison in it,” says Red.</p>

<p>“Poor Polly!” says Peg. “You better take a
last fond look at your bird, Red. For it’s heading
into sudden death.”</p>

<p>“You can’t scare me. Bring on your old
feather duster, you big bluffer. I’ll show <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“How are we going to work it?” says Peg,
squinting at the bristling black parrot with a calculating
eye.</p>

<p>“Search me,” says Red. “This is my first parrot
fight.”</p>

<p>“We might put ’em in the Cap’n’s churn and
crank it up.”</p>

<p>“Let’s put ’em in a big cage,” says Red. “Then
we won’t get clawed.”</p>

<p>Peg skidded into the store and came back
with a cage.</p>

<p>“I’ll put my bird in first,” says Red.</p>

<p>Old Solomon Grundy was boiling mad now.
<em>He</em> knew there was crooked work going on!</p>

<p>“Golly Ned!” says Peg, jumping back to save
his fingers. “Did you see him slap his tin shears
at me?”</p>

<p>Red purred.</p>

<p>“Talk to him,” says he. “Be gentle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
The big one tried it again.</p>

<p>“Hold ’er, Newt,” says Red. “She’s a-rearin’.”</p>

<p>“I pretty nearly lost an elbow that time,” says
Peg.</p>

<p>“Can’t we hold the cage doors together?” says
Red. “Then we can make old Solomon get into
the big cage. See?”</p>

<p>Peg shimmied around.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it,” says he. “Now, git a broom and
poke around in the small cage.”</p>

<p>Red gave a swat with the broom, shoving Peg
in the face.</p>

<p>“For the love of mud!” says the big one,
spitting up broom straws. “What do you think
you’re doing?—shooting pool?”</p>

<p>“The broom slipped,” says Red, trying to keep
his face straight.</p>

<p>“My right arm’ll slip,” says Peg, “if you don’t
back up. <em>Good</em> night! You sure are dumb.
Look where you’re shoving after this.”</p>

<p>“I did look,” says Red, “but you moved.”</p>

<p>They fooled around for several minutes, Peg
with the cage and the other one with the broom.
But let me tell you they didn’t put anything over
on Solomon Grundy!</p>

<p>“Now!” says Peg, shoving the cages together.</p>

<p>Red jabbed with the broom. He jabbed so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
hard he knocked the cage out of Peg’s hands.
Solomon Grundy was loose in the room now. And
was there <em>action</em>! Boy, if I live to be a hundred
and fifty years old I never expect to see anybody
move any faster than those parrot fighters did.
Around and around the room they went, ducking
and dodging the furious fighting bird. Sliding for
base, sort of, Red managed to get under the sofa.
In the same time Peg got into the bedroom.</p>

<p>Here the alley door opened.</p>

<p>“Um ... I kin see Donald Meyers under the
sofy,” says the newcomer in a cackling voice.
“What you doin’ under thar, Donald? Be you
hidin’ on the Cap’n?”</p>

<p>Before Red could answer there was a strangling
scream.</p>

<p>“Murder!” says Scoop, dropping down through
the trapdoor. “Come on, Jerry.”</p>

<p>Peg came running from the bedroom just as I
landed kerflop! in the middle of the sitting-room
floor.</p>

<p>“Who screamed?” says he.</p>

<p>“Old Caleb Obed,” says I.</p>

<p>Red crawled out of his hiding place. His eyes
were as big as saucers.</p>

<p>“I saw him,” says he. “Solomon Grundy flew
at him and he let out a screech and beat it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
Scoop was in the alley now. We could see him
crawling along on his hands and knees. He was
trying to capture something with his cap.</p>

<p>“H-h-ham!” says a familiar rasping voice.</p>

<p>I gave a cry.</p>

<p>“It’s Solomon Grundy!”</p>

<p>Too quick for the leader, the stuttering parrot
flopped its funeral-like wings and disappeared
over the roof of Red’s aunt’s millinery store on
the opposite side of the street.</p>

<h4>VOODOOISM</h4>


<p>Red and Peg were in a pickle. There was no
doubt about that. Their parrot fight having
ended in the escape of the black parrot—the
mystery parrot, as we now called it—they knew
that the Cap’n would go for them when he found
out what they had done.</p>

<p>Scoop and I hadn’t been asked in on the others’
fun. In fact the parrot fighters had acted kind of
smart with us. So now we paid them back by telling
them that the black parrot’s escape was their
funeral and not ours.</p>

<p>Still, we wouldn’t go back on them, we said,
having fun with them in their predicament. If
they ended up in the town jail we would call on
them, brotherly-like, and keep them in peanuts
and chewing gum.</p>

<p>Wanting to save his hide, Red said he guessed
he would hike into the country and visit his relatives
for a spell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
“My Uncle Charley keeps cows,” says he, “and
I can help him milk them. So he’ll be glad to
have me around.”</p>

<p>Scoop hooted.</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> milk a cow!” says he. “You’ll be telling
us next that you know how to husk pumpkins.”</p>

<p>“If a cow stepped on you,” says I to the guilty
one, “it would be worse than going to jail.”</p>

<p>“Stop talking about jail,” says he, shivering.
“You give me the jimjams.”</p>

<p>Scoop waggled serious-like.</p>

<p>“I wonder if it’s true,” says he, “that Bill Hadley
feeds his prisoners on bread and water.”</p>

<p>“Absolutely,” says I.</p>

<p>“I can’t swallow it, though,” says Scoop, “that
Bill really mixes the bread and water in the cat’s
dish.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen the dish,” says I.</p>

<p>This kind of crazy talk didn’t scare Peg like it
did poor Red. But just the same old hefty was
worried in the thought of what he had done. He
realized that he was in a serious predicament.</p>

<p>Then Scoop put his wits to work in the others’
behalf. The scheme that he suggested was a darb,
all right. But Red held off.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” says he, more worried than ever.
“What’ll my aunt say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
“She won’t know anything about it,” says Scoop.
“For she’s in Chicago, you say.”</p>

<p>“But why use <em>my</em> parrot?” says Red. “Why
don’t you use one of the store parrots?”</p>

<p>“They aren’t big enough,” says Scoop. “Yours
is the only one in the store Solomon Grundy’s
size.”</p>

<p>Red shrugged.</p>

<p>“All right,” says he, giving in. “I’ll take a
chance. But, boy, I can see my finish if I get
caught. You don’t know my aunt! She’s a rip-snorter,
let me tell you.”</p>

<p>It was the leader’s scheme to blacken Red’s
green parrot with soot and put it in the escaped
parrot’s cage. That would give us a chance to
capture the missing parrot without having an
empty cage in the wall hole to give us away.
Later on we would switch the real black parrot
for the sooted parrot. The Cap’n never would be
the wiser. He wouldn’t know that his black parrot
had been out of the house. Thus his temper
would be saved and our two chums would escape
trouble.</p>

<p>I was given the job of putting the sitting room
in order. And in returning the Cap’n’s dead
brother’s picture to its wall hook I noticed something
about the enlargement that had escaped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
me in the other times that I had handled the picture.</p>

<p>In the tattooing on the dead sailor’s bare chest
was a black parrot. It was the only thing pricked
into the skin in black ink. All around it were
colored designs—anchors and flowers and moons
and things like that.</p>

<p>While I stood there staring at the unusual picture,
my thoughts bobbing around in my head,
Scoop yipped to me to come into the kitchen and
see the fun.</p>

<p>I found him rubbing soot from the stove into
Red’s parrot’s green feathers.</p>

<p>“Solomon Grundy, Jr.,” says he, laughing.</p>

<p>The parrot eyed us reproachful-like in its
smudgy disgrace.</p>

<p>“Breakfast,” it whimpered. “Polly wants
breakfast.”</p>

<p>“What’ll you have for breakfast this morning?”
says Peg, in fun. “Some fried fishhooks or
some boiled shoe buttons?”</p>

<p>“Breakfast,” says the parrot again. “Polly
wants breakfast.”</p>

<p>I drew the leader into the sitting room.</p>

<p>“I’ve made a discovery,” says I.</p>

<p>“So did Christopher Columbus,” says he, grinning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
“Lookit!” says I, taking him up to the dead
sailor’s picture.</p>

<p>“A black parrot!” says he, following my finger.</p>

<p>“I bet you there’s a connection between this
picture and the real parrot,” says I. “For this
man owned the mystery parrot. He was a sailor.
And you know how many secrets a sailor has.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he was a pirate,” says Scoop, letting
his imagination jump along. “The pirate ship
was called the <em>Black Parrot</em>. See? And all the
pirates had this black-parrot symbol tattooed on
them.”</p>

<p>“And the real black parrot,” says I, “was the
ship mascot. Just like the cook’s parrot in <cite>Treasure
Island</cite>.”</p>

<p>The leader laughed.</p>

<p>“Jerry,” says he, “we’re a crazy pair. We’ve
got too much imagination.”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” says I, hanging on, “I bet you
there <em>is</em> a secret to the tattooed parrot. You wait
and see.”</p>

<p>We had planned to turn the store over to old
Caleb when he came around. That would give us
a chance to go parrot hunting. But to our surprise
the old man didn’t come back.</p>

<p>So we put Peg in charge of the store. Then
the rest of us started out, each one taking a different
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
course. I went to the left into Zulutown.
But nowhere on the house roofs or in the trees
did I catch sight of the escaped black bird.</p>

<p>Hoping that one of my chums had been more
successful than me, I started back, still keeping a
sharp lookout for the lost parrot. Pretty soon I
met Red limping down the street. He looked like
the last rose of summer.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ doin’,” says he wearily.</p>

<p>I was kind of grouchy.</p>

<p>“All we’ve done this week,” says I, “is search
for lost parrots. First it was your aunt’s parrot
and now it’s the Cap’n’s parrot. I suppose it’ll
be somebody else’s parrot to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The other one laughed.</p>

<p>“Poppy Ott ought to be here. For he’s a better
parrot hunter than us.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen Poppy since noon,” says I.</p>

<p>“I met him down town right after dinner,”
says Red. “He was making the rounds of the
stores for a job. But he hadn’t landed anything.”</p>

<p>“His pa’s got a job,” says I. “He’s going to
do night watching in Dad’s brickyard.”</p>

<p>Red waggled.</p>

<p>“I like that kid,” says he, thinking of our new
chum. “I hope he stays here.”</p>

<p>Coming to the store, we heard the Cap’n’s voice.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
But he wasn’t raving at Scoop and Peg. So we
knew he hadn’t found out about the soot trick.</p>

<p>“Howdy, b’ys,” says he, when we joined him
in the sitting room. “Awful hot afternoon, hain’t
it? I purty nearly melted rowin’ home. Um....
I’ve learnt a lesson, I have. The next time
I go fishin’ you won’t ketch me goin’ to sleep in
my boat.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a wilted voice came out of the wall
hole.</p>

<p>“Breakfast,” says Red’s parrot, whimpering-like.
“Polly wants breakfast.”</p>

<p>The Cap’n gave us a quick searching look.</p>

<p>“Um.... You b’ys kin go home now if you
want to,” says he, trying to get rid of us. “I
won’t be a-needin’ you any more to-day.”</p>

<p>“Breakfast,” says the parrot again. “Polly
wants breakfast.”</p>

<p>I remembered then that this “breakfast” talk
was about the only thing that Red’s parrot could
say.</p>

<p>Peg got my ear.</p>

<p>“Say, Jerry,” says he, “have you got your ventrilo
handy?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” says I, feeling in my pockets.</p>

<p>“Then you better crank it up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
“What do you want me to do,” says I, “make a
sound like a gold fish?”</p>

<p>“That blamed parrot of Red’s can’t stutter.
We never thought of that. So you’ve got to
stutter for it. See?”</p>

<p>Maybe you know what a ventrilo is. It’s a
little tin jigger that you put in your mouth to
throw your voice. Like in ventriloquism. I
paid ten cents for mine. The day I got it I took
it to school to fool the teacher. I thought it
would be fun to throw my voice into the wastepaper
basket. But I didn’t know how to work it
that day. I hadn’t practiced. And instead of
having fun with the teacher she spotted me right
off and sent me up to the principal.</p>

<p>But I learned how to work the ventrilo afterwards.
So I was ready now to do some voice
throwing at Peg’s orders.</p>

<p>“H-h-ham!” says I, trying as best I could to
make my voice sound like the black parrot’s.
“H-h-ham! Rattle their skulls, H-h-ham. Rattle
their skulls.”</p>

<p>The Cap’n was on needles and pins.</p>

<p>“You b’ys better clear out,” says he.</p>

<p>Scoop laughed.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Cap’n? Are you afraid
we’ll find out about your black parrot?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
The old man’s jaw fell.</p>

<p>“Heh?” says he, staring.</p>

<p>“We know you’ve got a black parrot over there
behind your brother’s picture,” says Scoop. “So
you needn’t try to cover up on us. We know it
was your brother’s parrot, too; and we know that
he paid you two thousand dollars for taking care
of it.”</p>

<p>“I swan!” says the fidgeting old man, sort of
gasping in his surprise. “What all <em>don’t</em> you b’ys
know?”</p>

<p>“H-h-ham!” says I again. “H-h-ham! Bring
me some h-h-ham and eggs and a b-b-bucket of
b-b-blood.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you give your bird some fresh
air?” says Scoop. “<em>Good</em> night! It’ll suffocate
in that hot hole. Have a heart, Cap’n.”</p>

<p>The old man was fearfully worked up.</p>

<p>“You b’ys keep ’way from that that pesky
par’ot,” says he in a panting voice. “Don’t you
go near it to let it git a crack at you. Cats an’
codfish—<em>no</em>! Why, if you knowed what I know
’bout that thar devilish par’ot you wouldn’t come
in the house even. No, you wouldn’t! <em>Me</em>—I
keep out of its reach, let me tell you. A feller,
saiz I, is got only one life to live, an’ I hain’t a-goin’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
to run no chance of havin’ my life cut short
by no voodoo par’ot.”</p>

<p>Scoop was dancing in excitement now.</p>

<p>“Voodoo parrot!” says he. “What do you
mean by that, Cap’n? Tell us.”</p>

<p>“B’ys,” says the old man, more composed now,
“that thar par’ot is a’ awful worry on my mind.
Yes, ’tis. Sometimes I wish that my fool brother
haid kep’ his devilish par’ot an’ his money, too.
Fur every minute that it’s in the house thar’s a
risk to me an’ to anybody who might come in.
That’s why I’m keepin’ the bird hid. I never
told you b’ys ’bout it, fur I didn’t want you nor
nobody else ’round here to know that it was here.”</p>

<p>“Is ‘voodoo’ a disease?” says Scoop.</p>

<p>At this question the old man then told us that
voodooism was a sort of sorcery practiced by the
natives of Haiti. On one of his trips to the island
the tattooed sailor had learned about a strange
“voodoo” parrot in a native temple. The natives
called it the “death parrot” because it was black.
They were afraid of its bite. It could kill people,
they said. It was a “voodooer.” The tattooed
sailor and another man named Bige Morgan got
up the scheme of swiping the black parrot in fun.
And one night they stained their bodies to look
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
like natives and got into the temple. Pretty soon
the natives all over the island knew that the voodoo
parrot had been stolen. They were crazy.
They found out about the two sailors. And to
save their lives the sailors put to sea on a raft.
The wind blew them into the ocean. Two or
three days later they landed on a coral island.
Here Bige Morgan died suddenly.</p>

<p>“When I first heerd the story,” says the Cap’n,
“I told Ham that it warn’t no par’ot bite that
killed Bige. Nope. He was p’isoned from
somethin’ he eat. Or mebbe it was a snake bite.
But Ham allus was a superstitious cuss. <em>He</em>
believed in spirits. Why, if I’ve heerd him tell
it once I’ve heerd him tell it a hundred times how
<em>he</em> was a-goin’ to come back when he was daid an’
talk to me. So, with them idears in his head, I
never could quite git him to believe that they was
no foundation to the voodoo story. An’ to that
p’int, b’ys, I calc’late that it warn’t no good thing
fur me to be talkin’ ’bout it so much to him. Fur
it’s a fact I kind of got a halfway superstitious
fear of the blamed par’ot myself. Ham wouldn’t
kill it. He was skeered to kill it—skeered, I
mean, that it would bring him bad luck. When he
was rescued from the island he took the par’ot
with him. An’ he haid it fur years an’ years before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
he died. He kep’ it shet up whar it coldn’t
git a whack at nobody with its bill. Since I
brought the par’ot home I’ve kep’ it shet up, too.
That was the safest plan. An’, as I say, when I
feed it I don’t git clost up to it. Fur it’s a fact,
b’ys, I don’t <em>know</em> that it hain’t a voodooer. I
kain’t hardly swallow the story. But on the other
hand I kain’t prove that they is no truth in the
story without me tryin’ the bird out on somebody;
an’, of course, I won’t never do <em>that</em>. Great guns—<em>no</em>!
So you kin see why I don’t want you fellers
to git near it. Jest leave it alone. Prob’ly nothin’
would happen if it did take a nip at you. Still, as
I say, I hain’t sure. It’s better, saiz I, to be
safe than sorry. The wrong time to wonder if
mushrooms is toadstools is after a feller is got ’em
in his stomick.”</p>

<p>Well, we didn’t laugh at the silly old man in
his own house. But we sure did whoop ’er up
when we were outside. Such a crazy story!</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” says Scoop, “we’ll catch Solomon
Grundy and switch birds on the old gilly.
Then in a week or two we’ll tell him the truth
about the parrot’s escape. It’ll put him easy, I
bet, to learn that the voodoo story is bunk.”</p>

<p>“If we’re going to keep his mind easy,” says I,
“we better keep him away from old Caleb.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
“Why so?”</p>

<p>“Old Caleb was bit by the parrot. Red says so.
And if the Cap’n finds out about it he’ll worry
himself sick.”</p>

<p>“We’ll call on old Caleb after supper,” says
Scoop, “and sort of hush him up.”</p>

<p>Knowing that the stuttering parrot had come
from Cedarburg, the same place where the mino
bird had been stolen, we had thought for a while
that there might be some secret connection between
the two unusual birds. But now we put this
thought completely aside. It was true that our
old friend had been in Cedarburg the week of the
mino bird’s theft. But that was just a happenstance,
Scoop said.</p>

<p>The thing that puzzled us now was the newspaper
advertisement. No mention had been made
of this by the Cap’n in his talk with us. Yet we
knew for a certainty that he had advertised the
black parrot for sale.</p>

<p>Was he cheating? Having promised his
brother to keep the bird, was he now trying to get
rid of it on the sly?</p>

<p>“We’ll ask him about the advertisement,” says
Scoop, “and see what he says.”</p>

<p>“Let’s quiz him about the spy, too,” says I.</p>

<p>“I had thought of doing that,” says the leader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
We figured now that the mystery was pretty
much cleared up. All that was left was the spy.
And the Cap’n probably could tell us who the
prowler was.</p>

<p>What we didn’t suspect was that the spy was
the biggest part of the mystery of all. Yes, sir,
the <em>real</em> mystery lay ahead of us. A lonely cemetery,
an empty grave, a weird voice out of another
world. <em>That</em> was the kind of stuff we bumped
into in working on the mystery.</p>

<h4>THE ROBBERY</h4>


<p>Mother was putting the supper on the table
when I got home.</p>

<p>“We won’t wait for your father,” says she, “for
Poppy’s hungry after his hard work and wants
to eat.”</p>

<p>I counted four plates on the table.</p>

<p>“Hot dog!” says I. “Is Poppy going to eat
with us?”</p>

<p>“He’s upstairs in the bathroom washing his
face and hands,” says Mother. “I asked him to
stay to supper. He’s a good boy, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“You tell ’em,” says I.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose he’s been doing this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Job hunting?”</p>

<p>“Not all the afternoon. He came to the back
door about three o’clock and asked me if he could
mow the lawn. I was surprised at first, for that’s
your job. Then I thought maybe you had asked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
him to do it. But he said you hadn’t. He wanted
to do it, he said, to repay us for the clothes we
gave him this morning.”</p>

<p>“I noticed that the grass was cut,” says I.</p>

<p>“He worked on the lawn for two hours. Then
he fixed the hinge on the back door. He’s handy
with tools.”</p>

<p>I hadn’t thought of Poppy doing anything like
this to repay us for the clothes we had given to
him. But I could see now that he had done the
right thing. He wasn’t the “gimme” kind of a
kid, that was one sure thing. He was willing to
work for what he got. I liked his spirit.</p>

<p>Giving my cap a throw, I beat it upstairs to the
bathroom.</p>

<p>“Hi,” says I, digging my new chum in the ribs.</p>

<p>“Hi, Jerry,” says he, acting glad to see me.</p>

<p>“You should have been with us this afternoon,”
says I. “We had a barrel of fun.”</p>

<p>“I was busy,” says he. Then he laughed.
“Say,” says he, his eyes twinkling, “do you know
where I can get a good wheelbarrow?”</p>

<p>I took my medicine with a grin.</p>

<p>“Any time you want a wheelbarrow,” says I,
“just write me a note.”</p>

<p>“I heard about the four fake notes,” says he,
laughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
“The Strickers are blabbing it all over town,
hey?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p>“They won’t think it’s so funny,” says I, “when
we turn the tables on them.”</p>

<p>“Do I get in on the fun?” says he eagerly.</p>

<p>“<em>Do</em> you?” says I. “Kid, we need you. For
there’s five of them. And with you on our side
we’ll be even numbers.”</p>

<p>Red weaved into the house while we were eating
supper. His stomach was all out of kilter,
he said, rubbing it. It was his sister’s baking-powder
biscuits.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t dast to go in swimming to-night,”
says he, waggling serious-like. “I’d sink.”</p>

<p>Mother laughed.</p>

<p>“Shame on you,” says she, “for talking that
way about your sister’s cooking. Clara is a
good cook for a young girl.... Is your mother
still in Chicago?”</p>

<p>“She went to Chicago with Aunt Pansy,” says
Red.</p>

<p>I grinned at the sufferer.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you eat here while your mother’s
away?” says I.</p>

<p>He jumped at the chance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
“Can I, Mrs. Todd?”</p>

<p>“No, you can’t,” says Mother. “I wouldn’t
offend your sister by encouraging you to come here
for your meals.”</p>

<p>A groan came from the unhappy one.</p>

<p>“If I die before Ma gets home,” says he, rolling
his eyes like a sick cow, “bury me under the
mulberry tree.”</p>

<p>“We’ll bury you under a gooseberry bush,”
says Poppy.</p>

<p>Supper over, my two chums went outside as
Dad breezed in.</p>

<p>“Well,” says he, mussing up my hair, “we have
a new night watchman at the factory.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ott?” says I, grinning.</p>

<p>“Sure thing. And for his son’s sake I hope he
tends to business and makes good. But I don’t
feel enthused. For he’s an absent-minded old
codger.”</p>

<p>“Jerry has been telling me some very interesting
things about this old detective and his son,”
says Mother. “The boys have taken Poppy into
their gang. And they’re going to take him to
school in September and help make a home for
him. I think that’s fine.”</p>

<p>Dad gave me a look that made me feel good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
“Jerry’s all right,” says he, bragging on me.
“I wouldn’t trade him for a million-dollar shoe
brush.”</p>

<p>Passing into the street, Poppy and Red and I
meandered to the corner, where we met Scoop and
Peg. The others were headed for old Caleb’s
place, so we joined them. Coming to the old
bachelor’s house, we found the front door wide
open. But no one answered when we knocked.
So we went around the house to the weedy garden,
thinking that the old man might be there. But
he wasn’t.</p>

<p>Peg got his eyes on a man next door.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mr. Obed?” says he.</p>

<p>“<em>Him?</em>” says old Paddy Gorbett. “I hain’t
seed him since the middle of the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“His front door’s wide open,” says Peg.</p>

<p>“Course ’tis. <em>He</em> never locks it. Why should
he? He hain’t got nothin’ in thar worth stealin’
’cept mebbe his stuffed birds.”</p>

<p>We had seen old Caleb’s case of stuffed birds.
He has a lot of them. Fixing up stuffed birds is
a hobby of his. He has been doing it for years.</p>

<p>Scoop was thirsty. And when he went into the
open house to get a drink we followed him. That
was all right. For old Caleb was our friend.</p>

<p>Red is quick with his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
“Lookit!” says he, pointing. “Here’s a new
bird. It must be Mrs. Solomon Grundy.”</p>

<p>We ran across the room to the stuffed-bird
collection.</p>

<p>“It’s a dead-ringer for the Cap’n’s parrot,” says
the observing one.</p>

<p>Peg saw a chance to start an argument.</p>

<p>“A black crow,” says he, turning up his nose.</p>

<p>“Like so much mud,” says Red, bristling. “It’s
a black parrot. See its bill.”</p>

<p>Poppy was interested in the stuffed bird.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a crow,” says he, “and it isn’t a parrot.
I wonder if it isn’t a mino bird.”</p>

<p>Red gave a yip.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s the stolen mino bird,” says he,
excited.</p>

<p>“Jinks!” says Peg, his thoughts jumping along.
“It could be. For old Caleb was at the sailor’s
funeral. Don’t you remember, fellows? He
went with the Cap’n.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” says I, checking back in my
memory.</p>

<p>“I bet a cookie,” says Red, “that this <em>is</em> the
stolen mino bird. Old Caleb hooked the bird
for his collection. See?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Strange told my father,” says Poppy,
“that she would pay him a thousand dollars for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
the mino bird. But, of course, the bird isn’t worth
anything to her dead.”</p>

<p>Red screwed up his forehead.</p>

<p>“Is she a mean woman?” says he, after a moment.</p>

<p>“Mean? I don’t think so. Why do you ask
that?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking,” says the freckled one, “that
she could put old Caleb in jail for this.”</p>

<p>I didn’t like the thought of old Caleb going to
jail. And I told the others that we ought to keep
still about the new stuffed bird until we knew for
sure that it was indeed the stolen mino bird.</p>

<p>Poppy took this as a direct hint.</p>

<p>“I give you my promise,” says he, “that I won’t
say anything to Pa about this. It would only
excite him and take his mind away from his work.
Anyway, he isn’t a detective any more—he’s a
night watchman. So why should I tell him? It
will be better for me to keep still.”</p>

<p>I grinned.</p>

<p>“You say your pa isn’t a detective any more,”
says I, “but <em>you</em> are.”</p>

<p>“No,” says he, shaking his head.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes you are,” says I. “Scoop and I and
Red and Peg are Juvenile Jupiter Detectives.
And if you’re going to be in our gang you’ve got
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
to be a Juvenile Jupiter Detective, too. It’s fun.”</p>

<p>“However,” says Scoop, laughing in the recollection
of the way old Mr. Arnoldsmith
skinned us, “it won’t cost you a dollar and a
quarter to get in, as it did each of us. We’ll let
you in free.”</p>

<p>It was getting dark now. We could hear the
Indian medicine man tooting his bugle to draw a
crowd to his free show. So we hurried down town
to see the fun.</p>

<p>A lot of people were gathered around the show
wagon. But we got good places up in front. A
kid always can do that. Bid Stricker was there.
I gave him a stiff-arm. He didn’t dast to shove
back, for he saw my gang. But he had a mean
grin. He was thinking about his wheelbarrow
trick, I suppose. I can’t bear that kid!</p>

<p>The Indian’s face was the color of my Sunday
shoes—a sort of reddish tan. He had long black
hair and black eyes. I never saw sharper eyes in
a man. He wore head feathers and his leather
pants and jacket had leather fringe. For shoes
he had on a pair of beaded moccasins.</p>

<p>Before he started doing his tricks he gave a
lecture, telling about himself. It was “me” did
this and “me” did that. His talk sounded silly
to me. If he was as smart in book education as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
he said, and really had been to an Indian college
in Pennsylvania, why didn’t he use his education
and say “I” instead of “me”? I figured it out,
though, that he talked this way to sound more like
a real Indian. It helped him to get business.</p>

<p>His magic tricks were better than his lecture.
White handkerchiefs were changed into fancy
flags; a wooden cube was made to cross the stage
from one hat to another. I don’t remember all
of the tricks. But that doesn’t matter. The only
trick that comes into my story is his “spirit writing.”</p>

<p>“My friend Bill,” says he, starting the trick,
“a heap fine friend Bill was. Poor Bill him die.
Bill him go to happy hunting ground. But Bill
him come back in spirit. Sure thing, Bill him
come back to-night. Bill him write spirit message.”</p>

<p>Here he passed out four blank sheets of writing
paper. And people wanting to get a “spirit letter”
from “Bill” were told to write their names on the
sheets. That was to mark them. Then the sheets
were rolled up together and put into a glass tube.
The tube was corked at the ends. We could see
the sheets through the glass. After a few minutes
the sheets were taken out. And what do you know
if they didn’t have writing on them!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
“Yes, Bill him heap smart spirit,” says the
Indian. “Bill him tell everything. Bill him tell
old bachelor how to get fine squaw. Sure thing.
White squaw. Me mean wife. You call him wife
and me call him squaw. One time Bill him tell
white man where money hid. Deep down in
ground. Man he go dig hole. Get money. Rich
man. To-morrow night Bill him write more spirit
letters. Maybe Bill him tell where more money
hid. Deep down in ground. Then <em>you</em> get rich.
Bill him heap smart spirit.”</p>

<p>At Scoop’s signal we got out of the crowd.</p>

<p>“Hot dog!” says he. “Now I know how we can
get even with the Strickers and pay them back for
that wheelbarrow trick. The ‘spirit letter’ trick
of the Indian’s gave me an idea. I know how to
do that trick. It’s easy.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it real magic?” says I.</p>

<p>“Real magic?” says he. “Don’t make me
laugh, Jerry. There isn’t such a thing as real
magic. The letters are written ahead of time with
invisible ink. And there’s a chemical in the corks
that causes the writing to show up when the sheets
are shut up in the tube. See? But Bid Stricker
doesn’t know the trick—I could tell so from his
face. All right—listen to this.”</p>

<p>There was some quick talk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
“Jinks!” says I. “Do you think you can work
it?”</p>

<p>“Leave it to me,” says the leader.</p>

<p>Red had some money. So we invited him to
treat us to ice-cream cones as a sort of celebration
of our coming revenge. Then we had some
bananas and chocolate bars.</p>

<p>It was ten-thirty now. So we got ready to do
some spy capturing in the Cap’n’s alley.</p>

<p>“It would be my scheme,” says Scoop, taking
the lead as usual, “to stretch a rope at each end of
the alley. We’ll let the man in. See? Then
when he tries to run away we’ll raise the rope and
trip him up.”</p>

<p>“He’ll get an awful bump,” says I.</p>

<p>“We should worry about that. The harder he
falls the easier it will be for us to capture him.”</p>

<p>“What are we going to do with him after we
get him?” says I.</p>

<p>“Make him talk. Maybe we’re all wrong in
thinking that old Caleb stole the mino bird.
Maybe it was this spy.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” says I quickly. “For I’d hate to
see old Caleb get into trouble.”</p>

<p>“If the spy has the stolen mino bird,” says Peg,
“or knows where it is, it’s a cinch, with him hanging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
around here this way, that there <em>is</em> some connection
between the two black birds after all.”</p>

<p>Scoop waggled.</p>

<p>“The Cap’n has told us a part of his parrot’s
secret. But I’m convinced that he hasn’t told us
everything. He’s keeping something back.”</p>

<p>“We should have quizzed him about the spy,”
says I.</p>

<p>“Yes,” says Scoop, “we could have done that.
But I think it will be more fun to capture the
spy and get his story first-handed. That’s my idea
of real detective work.”</p>

<p>So we got the Cap’n’s clothesline and cut it in
the middle. This gave us two ropes long enough
for our purpose. Fixing the ropes, one at each
end of the alley, we lay down in the dark.</p>

<p>It came eleven o’clock; then twelve o’clock.</p>

<p>“He ought to come pretty quick,” says Peg.
“For he was here at midnight last night.”</p>

<p>“Sh-h-h-h!” says Scoop.</p>

<p>“I hope he doesn’t come at all,” says Red, who
had been scared from the start.</p>

<p>“We’re five to his one,” says Scoop. “So
what’s there to shiver about?”</p>

<p>“He’s a man,” says Red. “And he’s got an
awful mean face. I’d hate to have him swish his
club at <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
Peg chuckled in the dark.</p>

<p>“I bet he’ll carry a knife to-night,” was the
way old hefty further cheered up the frightened
one. “A dagger with a double edge.”</p>

<p>Red gurgled.</p>

<p>“<em>Good</em> night!” says he. “Let’s beat it.”</p>

<p>We lay in hiding until one o’clock, then gave up
our job and started for home. We’d have to try
our luck some other night, we said.</p>

<p>The down-town streets were empty. No one
was in sight except us. But pretty soon the deep
quietness of the business section was broken by
a rattling flivver. The car came into sight on the
tear. As it passed us we saw that the driver was
Bill Hadley, the Tutter marshal.</p>

<p>“Something’s happened,” says Scoop, excited.
“Come on, fellows. Let’s follow him.”</p>

<p>We set out on the run. Bill, of course, was
traveling many times faster than us. But we
managed to keep his red tail light in sight.</p>

<p>“He turned into the brickyard,” says I, panting.</p>

<p>Poppy gave a queer throat sound.</p>

<p>“I knew it,” says he. “It’s Pa. He’s done
something.”</p>

<p>The brickyard office was all lit up. Dad was
there. We could see him through the open door.
We could see Bill Hadley, too, and old Mr. Ott.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
Dad had been rummaging the safe.</p>

<p>“Cleaned out as slick as a whistle,” says he.
Then he turned to Poppy’s father, who was standing
like a dumb-bell in the middle of the room.
“You’re <em>some</em> watchman, you are!... Lock
him up, Bill. For there’s a lot of money missing.”</p>

<p>The old detective got his voice.</p>

<p>“Heh?” says he, cackling-like. “Lock me up,
you say? Lock <em>me</em> up? What fur? I hain’t
done nothin’.”</p>

<p>Bill snapped a pair of handcuffs on the pottering
wrists.</p>

<p>“I’ve been suspicious of you,” says he, scowling,
“ever since you hit town.”</p>

<p>The old detective drew himself up.</p>

<p>“Um ...” says he in dignity. “Mebbe you
don’t know who I be.”</p>

<p>Bill grunted.</p>

<p>“I admit it,” says he, “but I hain’t worryin’
none about it.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” says the old man, “I want you to know
that I am a member of the purfession.”</p>

<p>“Which purfession?” says Bill, with a sneer.
“Safe crackin’ or bootleggin’?”</p>

<p>“I am a detective, sir,” says Mr. Ott in continued
dignity.</p>

<p>“You’ll be a ‘defective,’” says Bill, grim-like,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
“when I get through with you—you old crook!”</p>

<p>Poppy flew into the office then.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare to call Pa a crook,” says he,
facing Bill with flashing eyes. “For he isn’t a
crook. He never did a crooked thing in his life.
He’s queer. But he isn’t bad.”</p>

<p>Bill stared.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” says he.</p>

<p>“He’s my father,” says Poppy.</p>

<p>“In that case,” says Bill, “mebbe I better lock
both of you up.”</p>

<p>“Pa isn’t guilty,” says Poppy, dogged-like.
“He wouldn’t steal a penny, I tell you.”</p>

<p>Bill is awfully blunt.</p>

<p>“Is the old guy cuckoo?” says he, pointing to
the prisoner with a jab of his elbow.</p>

<p>Poppy flushed.</p>

<p>“No,” says he angrily, “Pa isn’t cuckoo. He’s
just queer. But that’s none of your business.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” says Bill, “queer and cuckoo
mean the same thing.”</p>

<p>That hurt Poppy. And at the moment I wished
I was big enough to knock the tar out of Bill.
The big bully!</p>

<p>Our new chum had his father by the arm now.</p>

<p>“What happened, Pa?” says he. “Tell me
about it. Maybe I can help you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
The old man acted dizzy.</p>

<p>“Why,” says he, feeling his way into his
thoughts, “I was a-sittin’ in here an’ all of a
sudden a man come in. He said he was the president
an’ general manager of the company. ‘You
hain’t the man what hired me,’ says I. ‘No,’ says
he, ‘that was my brother. We run the brickyard
together,’ says he. ‘I’m the president and general
manager and my brother’s the secretary and treasurer.’
He gimme a cigar an’ sit down at that
desk over thar an’ started fussin’ with them
papers. ‘Lots of times,’ says he, ‘I git up in the
middle of the night and come down here and work
for an hour or two.’”</p>

<p>“Did he ask you to open the safe so he could
rob it,” says Bill, sarcastic-like, “or did he open
it hisself?”</p>

<p>“<em>He</em> opened it. He did it while I was makin’
my rounds in the brickyard. When I come back
the safe was open, as I say, an’ the man was
gone.”</p>

<p>“And so was my three thousand dollars,” says
Dad angrily.</p>

<p>“I figured mebbe the safe door ought to be shet.
So I telyphoned to you, Mr. Todd. An’
then——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
“We know the rest,” says Dad, sort of disgusted-like.</p>

<p>“If they’s bin a robbery here,” says the old
detective, looking at the safe, troubled-like, “you
kain’t blame me. Fur the man said he was your
brother, Mr. Todd. Yes, he did. An’ when you
hired me you never told me that you didn’t have
a brother.”</p>

<p>Bill scowled at the stoop-shouldered prisoner.</p>

<p>“You’re a puzzle to me,” says he. “I don’t
know whether you’re the slickest crook that ever
hit this town or the dumbest.”</p>

<p>In the next hour Poppy’s father was taken to
the jail and locked up in one of the steel cages.
Our new chum was all broken up by the arrest.
It was discouraging, he said.</p>

<p>Then he clenched his fists, like a fellow does
when he gets ready to fight.</p>

<p>“I told you fellows that I didn’t care about
being a detective,” says he, his jaw squared. “But
I’ve changed my mind. I’m going to be a detective
and catch this robber. This was <em>your</em> case an
hour ago. But now it’s <em>my</em> case. I’m going to
take the lead, if you don’t mind. For I’ve got
more at stake than you have.”</p>

<h4>RED’S PREDICAMENT</h4>


<p>We were sore at Bill Hadley now. And I
must confess, too, that I was a little bit sore at
Dad. This thing of locking up Poppy’s father
was all wrong, we said—only, of course, not wanting
to hurt me, the other fellows didn’t say very
much about Dad’s part in the unfair arrest in
front of me.</p>

<p>The law had it figured out that the dull-minded
old detective knew more about the safe robbery
than he was willing to admit. He was acting
dumb to cover up, Bill Hadley said. But <em>we</em>
knew that the old man was innocent. And that
is why we were so het up over his arrest.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when I had cooled off, I had to
admit to myself that Dad had acted within his
business rights in ordering the old detective’s
arrest. For he didn’t know anything about the
old man’s character except what we had told him.
He had no proof that the odd-acting one wasn’t
a crook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
But you know how it is with a boy in a case
like that. He sort of lets his feelings decide
things for him. And just now, as I say, in a
steady belief in our new chum, our feelings told
us that old Mr. Ott was wholly innocent of any
unworthy part in the safe looting. And when
Poppy made the vow in front of the town jail
where the red water hydrant is that he’d go to
the ends of the world, as it were, to bring the real
thief to justice, and thus clear his father’s name,
we told him, as loyal pals, to lead on and we
would follow. We were with him until the last
dog was hung, we said.</p>

<p>And of the four of us no one was more sincerely
willing to accept the new leadership than Scoop,
himself. I thought that was pretty fine and generous
of my old chum. He had been the leader
heretofore. But now he was cheerfully willing
to let Poppy do the leading. He recognized
Poppy’s right to leadership.</p>

<p>That’s the way for a boy to be, I think. The
leadership “hog” doesn’t register with me at all.
A fellow has got to give and take in this world.
He can’t be the drum major and head the procession
<em>all</em> the time.</p>

<p>To go back to the old detective’s arrest, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
were sore at Bill Hadley, as I say. Dumb-bell
and bully that he was, he would get no help from
us, we said, in hot conversation. We would keep
away from him. We would work on our own
clews and pick up new ones. And in the end we
would show <em>him</em> a thing or two about clever
detecting.</p>

<p>You can see what I mean. <em>We</em> knew about the
spy. And, further, we knew that the spy, for unknown
reasons, was interested in the Cap’n’s
parrot. The spy, of course, was the man who
had robbed the brickyard safe. We had little
doubt about that. So all we had to do in order
to capture the law breaker was to lay for him
near the Cap’n’s store. We’d get him sooner or
later.</p>

<p>But first, we said, we would find out all we could
from the Cap’n about the mysterious prowler.
And in that plan we agreed to meet at the bird
store the following morning at nine-thirty.</p>

<p>Poppy went home with me that night. Mother
let us sleep late. Breakfast over, we went up the
creek to the jungle to take care of the rope-tailed
horse and see that everything was shipshape
around the wagon.</p>

<p>“You better lock up,” says I to Poppy, “and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
come home with me until your pa is free again.
Bring your horse, too. You can keep it in Red
Meyer’s barn. He won’t care.”</p>

<p>Going to the bird store, we found old Cap’n
Tinkertop in a peck of trouble.</p>

<p>“It’s Solomon Grundy,” says he, pottering
nervously about the room. “They’s somethin’ the
matter with him. He hain’t actin’ like hisself at
all.”</p>

<p>A wilted voice came out of the wall hole.</p>

<p>“Breakfast,” says the sooted parrot. “Polly
wants breakfast.”</p>

<p>The troubled look deepened in the old man’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“See?” says he, nervous-like. “They’s somethin’
the matter with that thar par’ot. He never acted
meek like that before.”</p>

<p>Poppy grinned.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s got the colic.”</p>

<p>“Um.... I wish he’d git the colic, or somethin’
worse’n the colic, an’ die. Yes, I do. It
would be a big worry lifted off <em>my</em> mind.”</p>

<p>Poppy got down to business.</p>

<p>“Did you ever try to sell your parrot?” says he.</p>

<p>The old man was caught off his guard in the
direct question.</p>

<p>“Heh?” says he, staring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
“One time in the ‘for sale’ column of a newspaper,”
says Poppy, “I saw an advertisement of a
black parrot. Was it your parrot, Cap’n?”</p>

<p>The old man was still staring.</p>

<p>“Heh? Was it <em>my</em> par’ot, you say? What’s
that?” The wrinkled face changed quickly. “Of
course it warn’t my par’ot,” came the sharp denial.
“Now git out of here, you kids, while I do up my
housework.”</p>

<p>He was lying to us. We could see that. And
it was because he feared further unwelcome questions
that he wanted to get rid of us.</p>

<p>But we didn’t budge.</p>

<p>“Night before last,” says Poppy, “a man was
seen at your window. My father tried to arrest
the suspicious-acting one and was knocked senseless.
Now we’ve got to capture this prowler in
order to get my father out of jail. Can you tell
us who he is, Cap’n?”</p>

<p>Here a customer came into the store and drew
its fidgeting owner’s attention. Nor would the
old man let us question him further that morning.
He was too busy to talk to us, he said, whenever
we brought up the subject of the spy. The real
point was that he didn’t want to talk to us. We
realized that.</p>

<p>What was he covering up? Was it a crime of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
some kind? Did he know what the black parrot
meant in its “blood” talk? And knowing the
death parrot’s probably wicked secret, did he
know, or suspect, who the spy was?</p>

<p>In regard to the newspaper advertisement, we
were convinced, as I say, that the secretive one
had openly lied to us. He <em>had</em> advertised his
black parrot for sale, notwithstanding his denial
to us. We had proof against him in the shape of
the clipping, itself. And, further, his actions had
convicted him.</p>

<p>But it was hard for us to understand <em>why</em> he
had advertised the parrot for sale. It was contrary
to his promise to his dead brother.</p>

<p>I went with Poppy that morning to visit his
father in the town jail.</p>

<p>“This is a’ awful poor jail,” says the prisoner,
his face clouded with dissatisfaction in his
cramped quarters. “I never was in a worse one.
No service at all. I didn’t even have a feather
pilly under my haid last night. An’ they’s lumps
like corncobs in the mattress.”</p>

<p>“Bill burnt up the pillows and the good mattresses,”
says I, “to kill the bedbugs.”</p>

<p>The old man scratched himself.</p>

<p>“No runnin’ water, either,” says he. “Poor!
Awful poor!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
“I’ll get you a drink,” says Poppy quickly.</p>

<p>“Um.... The toast was burnt this mornin’,”
was the further complaint. “An’ I didn’t have
enough butter on it. The coffee was muddy, too.”</p>

<p>I had come into the jail with a long face, wanting
the prisoner to see that I was sorry for him.
But now I had to grin. To hear him talk about
the jail’s poor “service,” you could have imagined
that he was the guest of honor in some swell hotel.</p>

<p>We questioned him about the robber, thereby
getting a fairly good description of the law
breaker. Burning eyes! Just as Red had spoken
of the spy’s peculiar eyes, so also did the old
detective now make similar mention of the safebreaker’s
eyes. So we knew beyond all doubt that
the spy and the robber were indeed one and the
same person.</p>

<p>We covered the town that morning, searching
for both the escaped black parrot and the robber.
But to no success.</p>

<p>Poppy paid his father another visit that afternoon.</p>

<p>“Maybe this’ll help us,” says he, when we were
all together again in the street.</p>

<p>“A cigar stub!” says Peg, seeing what the
leader had.</p>

<p>“I got it from Pa,” says Poppy. “It’s the cigar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
the robber gave him in the brickyard office.
Here’s the band. Now, let us find out who sells
cigars like this.”</p>

<p>Well, we went to all the stores in town where
cigars were sold. But the storekeepers all shook
their heads when we showed them our band.
They had no cigars like that in stock, they said.</p>

<p>“Which proves,” says Poppy, “that the robber
is an out-of-town man, as we suspected.”</p>

<p>Mother had said that Red couldn’t take his
meals at our house. But nevertheless I took him
home with me that night to supper, along with
Poppy.</p>

<p>There was a lot of talk at the table bearing on
the safe robbery. Bill hadn’t captured the robber,
Dad said. In this piece of news I winked at my
chums.</p>

<p>“Has Bill got any clews?” says I.</p>

<p>“He has a good description of the man,” says
Dad. “So it hadn’t ought to be much of a trick
for the law to catch him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose it ever occurred to Bill,” says
I, “that the robber is probably disguised.”</p>

<p>Dad stopped eating and looked at me sharply.</p>

<p>“Disguised?” says he. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Bill may have passed the man a dozen times
to-day without recognizing him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
“By George!” says Dad, excited. “I’ll tell
him about that.”</p>

<p>I grinned.</p>

<p>“You can’t beat a Juvenile Jupiter Detective,”
says I, bragging on myself.</p>

<p>“You admit it, hey?”</p>

<p>I put out my chest.</p>

<p>“I can’t deny the truth,” says I, still grinning.</p>

<p>“No? Well, Mr. Juvenile Jupiter Todd,
what’ll you and your gang of sleuths take to capture
this robber for me?”</p>

<p>“What’ll you give?” says I.</p>

<p>“Um.... Will a hundred dollars be too
much?”</p>

<p>“A hundred dollars apiece?”</p>

<p>“Say, why don’t you stick a gun under my nose
and hold me up right!”</p>

<p>“Make it a hundred dollars apiece,” says I,
“and we’ll do the job for you.”</p>

<p>He laughed. He thought I was talking through
my hat.</p>

<p>“All right,” says he, feeling safe in the generous
promise. “If you boys capture the robber
I’ll pay each of you a hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>Here Mother came into the conversation.</p>

<p>“Did I tell you, Donald,” says she to Red, who
was doing a sword-swallowing act with his fork
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
and a hunk of cake, “that I had a short letter
from your mother to-day?”</p>

<p>“I suppose she wanted you to get after me,”
says the freckled one, between bites, “and make
me wash up and put on clean clothes.”</p>

<p>Mother laughed.</p>

<p>“She did say something like that. But I took
it as a joke. What interested me in the letter
was her account of a dream that your aunt had.”</p>

<p>Red grunted.</p>

<p>“Aunt Pansy is always having ‘dreams,’” says
he. “Whenever she misses anything in her room
at our house she ‘dreams’ that I took it and I get
licked. Huh! Can I have another piece of cake,
Mrs. Todd?”</p>

<p>“The dream was about the escaped parrot,”
says Mother, passing the cake plate.</p>

<p>Red’s jaw dropped.</p>

<p>“Which parrot?” says he like a dumb-bell before
I could kick him under the table.</p>

<p>“Why, your aunt’s parrot, of course. The one
you captured yesterday.”</p>

<p>Red started breathing again.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” says he.</p>

<p>“Your aunt will be glad, I know, to learn that
her parrot is safe in its cage. For in her dream
she saw it in a black cistern.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
Red quit eating. He had lost his appetite.</p>

<p>“What’d I tell you?” says he, when we followed
him into the yard.</p>

<p>I grinned.</p>

<p>“Aunty spank, hey, when she finds out that her
’ittle nephew put nasty soot on Polly’s tail!”</p>

<p>“Aunty will pulverize me,” says he, shivering.
“Gosh! I knew I’d get into trouble in letting you
fellows black up her parrot. I was a dumb-bell
to consent to it.”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” says I. “Your aunt’s parrot will
be safe in its cage by the time she gets home. So
why worry? You aren’t in any danger.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know my Aunt Pansy! After
dreaming that her parrot was in danger she’ll ask
me a million questions about it. And if she finds
the least trace of soot.... <em>Good</em> night!”</p>

<p>Again we put in the evening at the Indian’s
medicine show, after which, in a plan to lay for
the spy, we headed for the Cap’n’s alley.</p>

<p>An automobile stopped near us under a street
light.</p>

<p>“Maybe you’d like to take a little ride this evening,”
says Mr. Meyers to Red.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” says the latter.</p>

<p>“Over to Ashton and back.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
“To get your mother and your Aunt Pansy.”</p>

<p>Red stared.</p>

<p>“I thought Ma and Aunt Pansy were in
Chicago?” says he.</p>

<p>“They stopped in Ashton on their way home
this afternoon. I just got a telephone call from
them asking me to drive over and get them.”</p>

<p>Red looked sick.</p>

<p>“You told me they weren’t coming home till
Friday,” says he.</p>

<p>Mr. Meyers laughed. He likes to joke.</p>

<p>“Your Aunt Pansy got homesick for her parrot,
I guess. She had a bad dream about it, you know.
I told her over the telephone that you had caught
the parrot for her. She says she’s going to give
you a big kiss.”</p>

<p>“<em>Good</em> night!” says Red, looking around for
a nice comfortable place to faint. “I’ll get something,
all right, but it won’t be a kiss.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing.”</p>

<p>Red’s sister hasn’t any patience with small boys.</p>

<p>“Well,” says she, from the back seat of the
car, “are you going with us, Mr. Importance, or
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Red sent them off without him. Then he
turned to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
“You fellows got me into this,” says he, “and
now you’ve got to get me out of it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” says Poppy. “We can get your
parrot easy enough. We’ll do that first.”</p>

<p>The bird store was in darkness. So we knew its
owner was in bed. Sometimes he goes to sleep
with his windows open. But we weren’t lucky to-night
in finding an open window.</p>

<p>However, we knew a secret way into the house.
So up the fire escape we went to the roof, the five
of us, and down through the scuttle into the attic.</p>

<p>Poppy had a flashlight. He was the first one to
drop into the sitting room through the raised
trapdoor. I followed. Then Scoop and Red
came down beside me. Peg stayed in the attic
to help us up.</p>

<p>The black parrot was sound asleep in its cage.
It didn’t see us at all.</p>

<p>“Grab it!” says I to Red, anxious to get away.</p>

<p>Poppy laughed.</p>

<p>“Be careful, though,” says he, “that it doesn’t
‘voodoo’ you.”</p>

<p>Red was afraid that when he touched the parrot
it would wake up and nab him. So to save his
hands he snatched a tidy from a chair and threw
the cloth over the sleeping bird. The wrapped-up
parrot was then handed to Peg, after which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
big one gave us his hands and drew us into the
attic. Closing the trapdoor, we got on the roof
and soon landed safely in the alley.</p>

<p>The clock in the tower on College Hill donged
eleven times. The spy was likely to be along any
minute now. And in planning the prowler’s capture
Poppy said that he and the other two would
do the trip-up stuff with the ropes while Red and
I cleaned the parrot.</p>

<p>Nobody was at home at the Meyers’ house.
So that was the best place to wash the parrot, Red
said. A few minutes later he and I turned in at
the darkened house. The front-door key was in
the mail box. Entering the house, we ran up the
stairs to the bathroom.</p>

<p>In the lead with the parrot, my companion
switched on the bathroom lights and gave the tidy
a shake. Out came the black parrot. But instead
of using its wings in its release from the tidy it
dropped to the floor with a dull hollow sound.</p>

<p>“What the dickens?...” says Red, staring.
Then he stooped quickly. “Jerry! <em>Look!</em>”</p>

<p>“The stuffed parrot!” says I.</p>

<p>I guess you can imagine how bewildered we
were in learning that the bird that we had lugged
home wasn’t the sooted parrot at all but old Caleb
Obed’s stuffed mino bird.</p>

<h4>THE BURGLAR</h4>


<p>Like the ship captain who staggered down the
stairs, Red yipped that he was lost. He’d catch
it now, he said, tearing his hair. Nothing could
save him.</p>

<p>“My aunt’s got an awful temper,” says he.
“She’s a regular old rip-snorter when she gets
going. And she’ll get Ma on her side and between
them they’ll salivate me.”</p>

<p>I was doing some fast thinking.</p>

<p>“You’ve still got a chance,” says I.</p>

<p>“The parrot’s lost,” says he, grabbing a fresh
handful of hair, “and I’m lost.”</p>

<p>“The thing for us to do,” says I, “is to stretch
our legs in the direction of old Caleb’s house.
For that’s where the sooted parrot is, I bet.”</p>

<p>But all he could do was to yip in despair.</p>

<p>“I’m a goner, Jerry,” says he, getting ready to
sink.</p>

<p>I felt like giving him a swift kick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
“You won’t be a goner,” says I sharply, “if
you’ll listen to me and do as I say.”</p>

<p>“But what can I do?” says he, with a helpless
look.</p>

<p>I told him my thoughts. The switching of the
stuffed bird for the sooted bird was undoubtedly
a trick of old Caleb’s, I said. Consequently the
old bachelor would know where the sooted parrot
was. So the thing for us to do was to run to his
house as fast as we could.</p>

<p>“Having spoiled his trick on the Cap’n,” says
I, “he may be sore at us at first. But he’ll give
up the sooted parrot to us when he learns the
predicament you’re in.”</p>

<p>Switching off the lights and locking the front
door, we hurried into the street. Coming to the
shabby house that we had visited the preceding
evening, we failed, as before, to get a response to
our raps.</p>

<p>Old Caleb had been known to drink moonshine.
Some men make fools of themselves that way.
And thinking that possibly he was drunk, we
struck a match and went inside the house, the door
of which still stood wide open. There was a hand
lamp on the sitting-room table. Lighting the
lamp with our match, we went into the bedroom
where the owner slept. But he wasn’t there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
Then we searched the house for the sooted
parrot. Failing to find it, or any trace of it, we
were forced to accept the conclusion that the old
man was away somewhere with the bird. That
in itself was something of a mystery, considering
the late hour.</p>

<p>More bewildered than ever, we went in search
of our chums to tell them our queer story. But
they weren’t in the bird-store alley. Not knowing
where to look for them, the only thing left for us
to do was to go home.</p>

<p>Coming to the Meyers’ house, we saw a moving
flashlight upstairs, which, in itself, told us that
the family had returned in the time that he had
been away.</p>

<p>Red sort of collapsed at the foot of the gallows.</p>

<p>“Oh!... I don’t want to go in, Jerry. I’ll
get an awful licking. Can’t you think of some
scheme to save me?”</p>

<p>“My thinker has a flat tire,” says I.</p>

<p>Here the telephone bell rang in the lower hall.
But no one came downstairs to answer the call.
That was queer, I thought.</p>

<p>Ting-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling went the bell.</p>

<p>Suddenly the thought came to me that the man
in the house wasn’t Mr. Meyers at all. It was the
burglar! You can imagine how excited I was. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
told Red my suspicions. And together we ran
to the barn where the automobile was kept. But
the car wasn’t there. So we knew now that the
house was being burglarized.</p>

<p>More excited than ever we ran back to the front
porch, noticing for the first time that the front
door was wide open. Upstairs the light had
moved into another room. Sharpening our ears,
we could detect the sound of disturbed dresser
drawers. Plainly every light thing of value in
the house was going into the burglar’s bag.</p>

<p>Hidden in the shrubbery near the front door
steps, my fingers suddenly closed over a wire that
Mrs. Meyers had put up for a porch vine to perform
on. At the touch of the heavy wire I
thought of our alley ropes and a plan popped into
my head. I told Red. Then between us we got
the wire down and stretched it from post to post
in front of the open door, after which we galloped
around the house to the back porch.</p>

<p>It was our scheme to make the burglar think
that we were about to enter the kitchen. Then
when he ran out of the house through the front
door our wire would trip him up and send him
sprawling on his snout. Red had a croquet mallet
and I had a paving brick. Between us we figured
that we could put the law breaker to sleep in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
jiffy, even if he didn’t nicely crack his neck in his
tumble down the steps.</p>

<p>Stomping on the back porch, and rattling the
doorknob, we then clattered in high hopes around
the house to our wire trap. And sure enough we
could hear the alarmed burglar sliding for first
base down the stairs. A form darted into sight
through the open door. It was a man.</p>

<p>Gee-miny crickets! You should have heard the
yelp that came out of the burglar when he struck
our stretched wire. He had stuffed several of
Mrs. Meyers’ pillowcases full of loot and now
the contents of the pillowcases flew in all directions.
The air was full of flying arms and legs
and silver spoons.</p>

<p>Running forward to land on the sprawled law
breaker with my five-pound paving brick, I was
suddenly struck in the face by something from
one of the pillowcases. I began to spit feathers—nasty
tasting feathers. Phew! All I could think
of at first was a feather duster dipped in filth.
Then, realizing that I had headed into something
a lot more lively and dangerous than a feather
duster, I dropped the paving brick with a wild
yelp and clutched my hooked nose.</p>

<p>“Breakfast,” says the feathery mess that had
fastened itself to my nose. “Polly wants breakfast.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</h3>
</div>

<h4>POOR POLLY!</h4>


<p>Red bragged afterwards that he whacked the
burglar six times with his croquet mallet before
the housebreaker got up and scooted into the
night. But I can hardly swallow that heroic story.
For I know Red! That same week his mother
discovered a crack in her fancy lawn urn. And
if the rattle-headed one hit anything at all I bet
a cookie it was the urn.</p>

<p>However, the man wouldn’t have gotten away
from <em>me</em>, let me tell you, if it hadn’t been for that
blamed parrot. Yes, sir, if Solomon Grundy, Jr.,
hadn’t handicapped me by attaching himself to the
roof of my nose, I would have landed neatly on
the escaping one’s cranium with my paving brick.
One swing of my trusty right arm and Mr. Burglar
would have been a dish rag.</p>

<p>But the point is that the law breaker <em>did</em> get
away from us. That was a big disappointment.
Yet, with the sooted parrot miraculously delivered
into our hands in the eleventh hour, so to speak,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
we couldn’t kick on the way Fate was managing
things for us. There was mystery in the burglar’s
possession of the sooted parrot, but we didn’t let
that confuse us—not then! We had other things
to think about.</p>

<p>The burglar’s loot was scattered all over the
lawn. In the mess of stuff we picked up an Ingersoll
watch and Mrs. Meyers’ silver-backed dresser
set and the solid silver shaving mug that Red got
as a premium for selling twenty colored pictures
of “Washington Crossing the Delaware” and
probably forty or fifty pieces of table silver, such
as spoons, knives and forks.</p>

<p>Dumping the recovered loot into the hall, we
scooted up the stairs to the bathroom. Turning
on the water in the tub, some hot and some cold,
we made a deep oozy suds and got busy on the
bird, finding to our great satisfaction that the soot
came off easily.</p>

<p>“Breakfast,” says the blinking, bedraggled
parrot, eyeing us reproachful-like. “Polly wants
breakfast.”</p>

<p>I grinned at Red.</p>

<p><a id="bawth"></a>“It isn’t every parrot,” says I, sloshing around
in the suds, “that has two servants to give it a
bawth.”</p>

<p>He laughed at that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
“It’s a good thing,” says he, “that the parrot
can’t tell on us. Or I’d catch it from my aunt—bu-lieve
me!”</p>

<p>“Here,” says I, shoving a towel at him, “take
this and finish the job.”</p>

<p>In the drying process the parrot suddenly stiffened
out like a poker.</p>

<p>“Holy cow!” says Red, his eyes swelling in
horror. “It’s dead!”</p>

<p>I told him that the parrot probably had swallowed
too much water. And knowing the trick of
reviving a drowning man by pumping his arms
up and down, I got busy and pumped the parrot’s
wings. But to no good results. Nor did the
feathered hunk stir when I gave it a whiff of Mrs.
Meyers’ smelling salts.</p>

<p>Red was tearing his hair again.</p>

<p>“It’s dead, I tell you,” says he, suffering at the
top of his voice. “Oh, oh, oh! Now I’m in for
it worse than ever.”</p>

<p>Here an automobile cantered down the street
and stopped in front of the house. I thought sure
it was Red’s people. And of no desire to be
caught in the house with the guilty one and his
dead parrot I beat it for the stairs.</p>

<p>In the excitement my chum had forgotten about
his earlier intention of staying all night with me.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
But he remembered it now. And grabbing the
parrot, eager to delay his punishment, he made
quick work of following me down the stairs to
the lawn, where we saw the car that we had
thought was his father’s turning into a private
drive on the opposite side of the street.</p>

<p>On the hall table in my home I found a note
from Mother explaining that Mr. Meyers, stalled
in his auto halfway between Ashton and Tutter,
had telephoned to Dad to come and pick him
up.</p>

<p>“If you get home before we do,” the note concluded,
“please don’t forget to lock the doors
when you go to bed. For we don’t want to have
another robbery in the family.”</p>

<p>Wanting to do the handsome thing by my company,
I set out a bedtime lunch of two bananas
apiece and some cookies and half a lemon pie,
after which we headed for our roost. As I was
undressing I suddenly noticed that my invited bedfellow
was acting queer. His mind seemed to be
somewhere else. I thought, of course, that he was
worrying about the dead parrot. But it wasn’t
the parrot that he was thinking about, he said, it
was his pajamas—he had forgotten to bring them
along. I told him that he could use a pair of my
pajamas. But, no, he held off, he had to have his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
own night clothes. So home he went to get them.</p>

<p>He was gone about five minutes. I was sitting
on the edge of the bed when he came upstairs.
Not for one instant had he fooled me. It wasn’t
the need of pajamas that had taken him back
home—I realized that. He had a hidden reason.</p>

<p>While I was debating in my mind whether I
should ignore him or pump him, a car drove into
the yard. A few moments later footsteps sounded
on the front porch and my parents came into the
house.</p>

<p>I heard Dad lock the door. Then the telephone
bell rang.</p>

<p>“Yes,” says Mother, in answer to a question
that had been put to her over the wire. There
was a moment’s silence. “Why, how dreadful!”
came the cry. “Yes, indeed—we’ll come over
right away.” Dad was called. “It’s Mrs.
Meyers,” says Mother in continued excitement.
“Their house has been robbed. Even the parrot’s
gone. And she says the filthy thief had the nerve
to take a bath in her clean tub—there’s a ring
on the tub, she says, that looks just like soot.”</p>

<p>At first surprised and puzzled that Red’s folks
should completely overlook the stuff in the front
hall, I suddenly tumbled to the truth of the
matter. To escape a licking in the parrot’s unfortunate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
death my tricky chum had hidden the
burglar’s loot. That is what had taken him home.
No wonder his folks thought they had been
robbed!</p>

<p>“It’s queer,” says I, in a scheme to pry the
tricky one out of his hole, “that your folks overlooked
the stuff in the front hall. For we left
everything in a pile.”</p>

<p>He didn’t say anything.</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell Dad,” says I, starting to pile
out of bed.</p>

<p>He stopped me.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that, Jerry. Please. You’ll get me
in an awful fix if you do.”</p>

<p>“You’re already in a fix,” says I.</p>

<p>“Not like you think.”</p>

<p>Here was my chance.</p>

<p>“Red Meyers,” says I, giving him a scowl,
“what have you been up to?”</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t want to get licked, Jerry. So I
made a bundle of the stuff that we picked up on the
lawn and dumped it into your ma’s cistern.”</p>

<p>I gave a squeak.</p>

<p>“For the love of mud!” says I weakly.</p>

<p>Here Mother came to the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>“Are you awake, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” says I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
“I thought I heard voices up there. Did you
hear me tell your father about the robbery?”</p>

<p>Red gripped my hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t squeal on me, Jerry,” says he, begging.</p>

<p>I didn’t. For when a fellow is your chum,
even if he does something sneaking, you’ve got to
stand by him to sort of help him square himself.</p>

<p>But I read the tricky one a sharp lecture, let me
tell you, when we had the house to ourselves,
Mother having hurried to the scene of the “robbery”
to comfort the weeping parrot owner, and
Dad to help his excited neighbor go over the
yard for clews.</p>

<p>Instead of having benefited himself, I lectured
the culprit, he had gotten himself, and all the rest
of us, into a deeper hole than ever.</p>

</div>

<h4>THE VANISHED TOWNSMAN</h4>


<p>At the breakfast table the following morning
Dad joked me, in his usual jolly way, about my
skinned nose, inquiring, chummy-like, if I had been
in a scrap with the Stricker gang, to which I
replied truthfully that I hadn’t.</p>

<p>Red was fidgety in the conversation. He was
scared that the older one would pin me down and
thus learn the truth about my nose scratches. So
it was a relief to both of us when my talkative
parent was called to the telephone.</p>

<p>“Who was it?” says Mother, when Dad came
back to the table with a big grin on his face.</p>

<p>“Bill Hadley. He wants me to bring a few of
our new talking-machine records down to the jail.”</p>

<p>“Talking-machine records?” says Mother, puzzled
at the marshal’s sudden interest in music.
“Why is he calling on <em>you</em> for records?”</p>

<p>“Because his prisoner is partly my responsibility,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“You mean Mr. Ott?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
“Sure thing. Bill says the old gent did a lot
of kicking yesterday on the service he was getting.
So our accommodating marshal has been stepping
around since to redeem himself. He even has a
Victrola in the cell now.”</p>

<p>Mother isn’t crazy over Bill, though she’s
awfully chummy with his wife, an old school
teacher of mine.</p>

<p>“What nonsense!” says she.</p>

<p>“I forgot to ask him,” says Dad, in continued
laughter, “whether he wanted Caruso records or
jazz.”</p>

<p>“Bill might better forget about his sense of
humor and do his work,” says Mother stiffly,
thinking of the burglar.</p>

<p>“Oh,” says Dad, who is never too busy or too
worried to enjoy a good joke, “there’s time for
a little fun on every job.”</p>

<p>Red and I had heard enough to want to get
down town in a hurry. So as soon as breakfast
was over we grabbed our caps and scooted into
the street.</p>

<p>Bill Hadley scowled at us when we tumbled into
the town hall where he has his office. That’s his
way with kids. He does it to make us realize the
importance of his position, I guess.</p>

<p>“What’s the idea of all the racket?” says he
sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
“We came down to see the fun,” says I, grinning.</p>

<p>“What fun?”</p>

<p>“You know—what you told Dad over the telephone.”</p>

<p>That brought out a grin.</p>

<p>“Um.... Mr. Ott is busy with his mornin’
newspapers jest now. But I guess you kids kin
take a peek at him if you’ll promise to be quiet an’
not disturb him.”</p>

<p>Tiptoeing into the back room where the steel
jail cages were, I thought I’d die when I saw the
way the prisoner’s cell had been dolled up. On
one steel wall was a long pansy picture—“A Yard
of Pansies” is the right name for it, I guess—and
on the opposite wall was a “God Bless Our
Happy Home” sampler. A fancy curtain hung
over the steel door. The floor was covered with
a swell red rug—as I remember, it was a rug with
a picture of a pony in the center—and the cell
was further brightened up with a reading lamp,
a potted fern, a magazine table, a smoking stand,
a talking-machine and an easy chair. Cooled by
the breeze from an electric fan, the contented
prisoner was now stretched at ease in the soft
chair, his lap full of newspapers.</p>

<p>“Um....” says he, looking up and getting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
Bill’s eye. “I furgot to tell you, Mr. Hadley,
that I don’t like tea of any kind. So don’t ever
bring me none. Coffee is what I like, with a lot
of rich cream in it—an’ not condensed cream,
nuther.”</p>

<p>Bill gravely got out a memorandum book and
pretended to write in it.</p>

<p>“Coffee,” says he slowly, “with a lot of cream
in it—real cream from contented cows. An’ how
much sugar, Mr. Ott?”</p>

<p>“Um.... Two spoonfuls, if you please.”</p>

<p>“Anything else?”</p>

<p>The old man pondered.</p>

<p>“I kain’t jest recollect anything special right
now. But when Poppy comes around, you’re to
send him right in. Fur I want to see him.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Mr. Ott,” says Bill, acting as
though he was taking orders from a king.</p>

<p>Well, Red and I pretty nearly busted ourselves
laughing when we were outside. Bill was funny,
we said. But when Poppy came down the street
with Scoop and Peg, and learned about the decorated
cell, he was mad as hops.</p>

<p>“They’re making a monkey of Pa,” says he,
his eyes flashing. “I wish I was big enough to
lick the guy who started it.”</p>

<p>He hurried into the jail then. And I guess he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
told Bill Hadley a thing or two. For, bu-lieve
me, that kid knew how to use his tongue. I’ll tell
the world! And he wasn’t afraid of anybody,
either.</p>

<p>Checked up by our new chum, I was ashamed of
myself now to think that I had laughed on Bill’s
side. As Poppy had said, the officer was making a
monkey of the old prisoner, and that wasn’t the
right thing to do. Still, I considered, as long as
the old man had to be locked up in jail it was just
as well that he had everything cozy and comfortable.
That was a lot better for him than being
discontented.</p>

<p>“Pa is nobody’s fool,” says Poppy, when he
came back to us. “<em>He</em> thinks the joke is on the
marshal. And I’m not so sure that it isn’t.”</p>

<p>“I thought maybe he had something more to
tell you about the safe robber,” says I.</p>

<p>“No. He just wanted to show me how his cell
was fixed up. <em>I</em> was mad about it. But he told
me to keep my mouth shut. He knew what he
was doing, he said.”</p>

<p>We started down the street then.</p>

<p>“I suppose you wonder where I was last night,”
says Poppy, linking arms with me.</p>

<p>“Did you stay with Scoop?”</p>

<p>“I had to, when I lost track of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
“Red stayed at my house,” says I.</p>

<p>He grinned.</p>

<p>“If I had been there we could have had some
fun, hey?—three in a bed.”</p>

<p>“Not <em>last</em> night,” says I, serious.</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“Too many queer things happened last night
for fun,” says I.</p>

<p>That turned his thoughts back.</p>

<p>“Did you know, Jerry, that we saw the spy last
night? Sure thing. He came into the alley, but
not far enough for us to trip him up.”</p>

<p>“We would have gotten him, though,” put in
Scoop, “if Peg hadn’t coughed on a bug. He
beat it then.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you follow him?” says I.</p>

<p>“We tried to,” says Poppy, “but he was too
slick for us.”</p>

<p>Here I told the others the truth about the
Meyers robbery. Amazed at first at our surprising
adventure, they almost threw a fit when they
learned what a clever little “fixer” Red was.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” says Scoop, rocking his head in his
hands. “Nobody at home! Kid, if ever there
was a poor fish that flopped out of the frying pan
into the fire it’s you.”</p>

<p>But this kind of talk didn’t upset Red. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
stepped around as unconcerned as you please.
Having escaped a licking in his trickery, everything
was lovely with him now.</p>

<p>“Tra-la-la,” says he, showing off. “Listen to
the praise I’m getting.”</p>

<p>“It’s the craziest scheme I ever heard tell of,”
says Peg. “The idea of dumping all that stuff
into a <em>cistern</em>! Ye bums and buttered biscuits!
And the less credit to you, Red Meyers, it’s an out
and out lie. Yes, it is. Letting your folks believe
that they have been robbed is just the same as telling
them a lie.”</p>

<p>“Tattletale!” says Red.</p>

<p>Peg colored up.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t tattle on you,” says he steadily.
“But I can tell you this much, kid: If you don’t
square yourself with your folks at the first opportunity
you’re out of my gang for life. Get
me? I may not be perfect, but I’m no sneak.
And, further, you’ve got to buy your aunt a new
parrot. I’ll help on that, for in coaxing you into
the parrot fight I’m as guilty in the parrot’s death
as you are.”</p>

<p>Poppy didn’t jump on Red like the others.
That wasn’t his style. Anyway, he hadn’t known
us for so very long and therefore was kind of
careful in his talk to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
“What became of the dead parrot, Jerry?”
says he, getting my eye.</p>

<p>I shrugged.</p>

<p>“Ask Red,” says I. “He had it last.”</p>

<p>“Like fun I did,” says freckle-face, stiffening.
“<em>You</em> had it last. Don’t you remember?—I
handed it to you when I locked the front door.”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> locked the front door,” says I.</p>

<p>“Yes, you did—<em>not</em>.”</p>

<p>“I did, too.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t.”</p>

<p>That’s Red for you. He’ll argue when he
knows he’s wrong. Bullhead stuff, I call it. Of
course, <em>I</em> was right.</p>

<p>Poppy then questioned us about the burglar,
wanting to know if we had gotten a look at the
man’s face, or had heard his voice. And after
considerable talk back and forth we came to the
general conclusion that the man Red and I had
seen and the man who had robbed the brickyard
safe was unquestionably one and the same person.
For the description of one fitted the other.</p>

<p>But it puzzled us to understand why the criminal
was hanging around town. He had Dad’s
three thousand dollars. Why then didn’t he play
safe and beat it?</p>

<p>Was he waiting for a chance to steal the black
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
parrot? Was there some secret reason—some
very important reason—why he had to have the
unusual parrot? And was it his scheme to get
possession of the parrot, through hook or crook,
and then make a break for safety?</p>

<p>In planning things our decision was that it
would pay us to keep on guarding the alley. We
would go there every night, we said. And sooner
or later we would succeed in the criminal’s capture.</p>

<p>In the course of our conversation I mentioned
old Caleb Obed.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose,” says I, “that the spy and
old Caleb are in cahoots?”</p>

<p>Poppy got my eye.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” says he quickly.</p>

<p>“Sometime last evening,” says I, “old Caleb
switched birds on the Cap’n. In running off with
the sooted parrot he thought, of course, that he
had the real Solomon Grundy. Later on, as we
know, the parrot turned up in the robber’s hands.
So Caleb either gave it away or had it stolen
from him.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me,” says Scoop, “that I tried
to find old Caleb yesterday afternoon and couldn’t.
Nobody around here seems to know where he is.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
So you may be wrong, Jerry, in thinking that he
was in the Cap’n’s store last night.”</p>

<p>“But who else could have switched the birds?”</p>

<p>“Search me.”</p>

<p>“I bet it was old Caleb,” says Peg. “For he’s
a deep one, let me tell you. I’ve had a hunch all
along that he knows things that he doesn’t want
us to know. And instead of giving all of our
attention to the spy, it would be my suggestion
that we keep an eye on the old man, too.”</p>

<p>Here a boy friend of ours came down the street
on the run with a note for me.</p>

<p>“It’s from Cap’n Tinkertop,” says the kid,
panting. “He says it’s important.”</p>

<p>I opened the note, wondering what had happened
in the bird store to thus cause our old friend
to write to me.</p>

<p><em>Thirteen!</em></p>

<p>This single word, written over the Cap’n’s
sprawled signature, was the only message that the
crumpled note contained. But I understood the
message. And showing the others the note, which
I knew was no trick of the Strickers’, I led my
chums an excited and breathless race down the
street to the bird store.</p>

<p>“Thirteen,” I might explain, is our danger
signal. Known only to ourselves and to a few
of our trusted friends, of whom the Cap’n was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
one, it was supposed to be used only in moments
of great peril.</p>

<p>We found the bird-store proprietor quavering
behind closed doors and drawn window shades.</p>

<p>“B’ys,” says he, in a husky voice, “I’m in a’
awful fix. I’m perty near crazy, I be. Jest look
at me sweat! I’m wringin’ wet,” and he swabbed
his drenched face with a soggy handkerchief.</p>

<p>There was an open traveling bag on a chair.
And we saw that its owner had been packing it.</p>

<p>“I’m gittin’ ready to flee,” says he. “It’s that
or go to jail. An’ I hain’t a-goin’ to let the law git
its hands on me to hang me if I kin help it.”</p>

<p>“What have you done,” says Poppy, troubled,
“that the law should be after you?”</p>

<p>The old man panted.</p>

<p>“It’s that blamed par’ot, b’ys.”</p>

<p>“Your black parrot?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s bin stole. Some one took it on me
last night. But that hain’t the cause of my
trouble. The thing that’s worryin’ me is what
the par’ot did before it was stole.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“It’s gone an’ voodooed a man. Yes, it hais,”
the voice stiffened, as one of us laughed, “an’
you needn’t act smart ’bout it, nuther. It hain’t
no laughin’ matter, let me tell you. Jumpin’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
Jupiter—<em>no</em>! Fur if the man is daid, as I suspect,
the only thing fur me to do to save my neck from
the gallus is to git out of the country. Otherwise
the law’ll take me in hand an’ hold me responsible,
it bein’ my par’ot.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cap’n!” says Poppy. “Don’t be a goose.
There’s no truth in that crazy voodoo story. It
<em>can’t</em> be true.”</p>

<p>The packer went on with his work.</p>

<p>“Aw!... Come out of it, Cap’n. You don’t
have to skin out of town. Of course not. You’ve
just had a bad dream.”</p>

<p>The gingerbread eyes sought ours.</p>

<p>“B’ys, be you a-goin’ to stand by me?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” says Poppy quickly. “But——”</p>

<p>“They hain’t no ‘but.’ I know what I’m talkin’
’bout. Somewhar at this very minute ol’ Caleb
Obed is layin’ daid—struck down an’ killed by that
thar devilish voodoo par’ot.”</p>

<p>“Caleb Obed!” came the cry from our new
leader, looking at us.</p>

<p>“You b’ys don’t know it, but ol’ Caleb called to
see me the afternoon I was down the river. Jest
heow long he was in the store I kain’t say. No
one to my knowledge saw him go in. But Matsy
Bacon saw him come out. He was runnin’,
Matsy saiz, an’ screechin’ to beat the cars. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
was blood on his face. ‘The par’ot!’ he screeched.
‘The black par’ot!’ Wal, Matsy <em>he</em> figured it out
as heow the screecher was on another toot.
‘What’s the matter, Caleb?’ saiz he. ‘Be you
seein’ black par’ots this time ’stead of green an’
yaller rattlesnakes?’ An’ then, so Matsy saiz,
Caleb he screeched, ‘It flew at me an’ tried to kill
me.’ After which, so Matsy saiz, the screecher
went down the street on the trot, sort of limpin’
an’ staggerin’.</p>

<p>“Matsy told me the hul story this mornin’ when
he was in the store. ‘Did you know,’ saiz he,
thinkin’ as heow it was a good joke, ‘that one
of your par’ots slivered a hunk of skin out of ol’
Caleb Obed the other afternoon?’ Figurin’ that
Matsy was up to some kind of nonsense, I saiz,
in fun, ‘So one of my par’ots bit a hunk out of
ol’ Caleb, hey? Fine! Now I won’t have to buy
the par’ot no fresh meat.’ Wal, we talked some
more, me an’ Matsy. He told me ’bout seein’
Caleb come out of my alley door. I in turn told
him how a certain par’ot of mine had bin took
from my store last night between nine o’clock an’
midnight, only, of course, I didn’t tell him it was
a real black par’ot, fur he never dreamed fur one
minute that I had sech a thing in the store.
‘Mebbe,’ saiz Matsy, in further fun, ‘it was ol’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
Caleb who hooked your par’ot on you in revenge;
an’ mebbe he hooked the other par’ot, too.’
‘What other par’ot?’ saiz I. ‘Last night,’ saiz
Matsy, ‘they was another par’ot stole on Main
Street.’”</p>

<p>“We know about that,” says Poppy, giving Red
a queer look.</p>

<p>“Wal, Matsy an’ me we talked some more.
An’ then, b’ys, it come to me all of a sudden
that here was a test case. I warn’t scared at
first like I be now, but I was awfully excited.
An’ I lit out fur ol’ Caleb’s house on the trot,
wantin’ to see fur sure that he was all right an’
haidn’t been voodooed. The nearer I got to his
place the more fidgety I got. Suppose, I saiz to
myself, that I should find him daid after all. Of
course I wouldn’t, I saiz, tryin’ not to believe the
voodoo story. But jest suppose I <em>should</em>. What
would happen to me then? Wal, I come to
Caleb’s house ... it was wide open ... but
he wasn’t thar! He haidn’t bin thar, Paddy Gorbett
told me, since day before yeste’day at three
o’clock. I saiz, foxy-like, ‘When you seed him
then, Paddy, did he have red paint on his face?’
‘Was it paint?’ saiz Paddy. ‘I thought it was
blood.’ I held myself steady, not wantin’ to git
him suspicious of me. ‘Did he tell you,’ saiz I,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
‘how the blood come to be thar?’ ‘No,’ saiz
Paddy, ‘I didn’t talk with him.’</p>

<p>“An’ that, b’ys, is my story. Mebbe I’m a ol’
gilly, as you think. Mebbe they hain’t a particle
of truth in the voodoo story. When I told you the
story I didn’t half believe it myself. But now I’m
preparin’ fur the worst. Yes, sir, I’m a-goin’
to git everything in readiness, without anybody
seein’ me, so that I kin skin out on a moment’s
warnin’. An’ thar is whar you kin help me. With
your young legs you kin git ’round spry an’ cover a
lot of territory. Besides, as I know, you’re perty
smart at pickin’ up clews an’ sech. What I want
you to do fur me is to find ol’ Caleb, or find his
body. An’ if he’s daid, as I think, I want you to
come here an’ tell <em>me</em> first. As you kin see I’m
innocent of any intended wrongdoin’—I’m a
victim of circumstances, as the sayin’ is. An’ as
an ol’ friend of yours who has always stood by you
in thick an’ thin, an’ seein’ as heow you already
know the par’ot’s secret, I feel I’ve got a right,
under the circumstances, to ask this of you. Don’t
repeat a word of what I’ve jest told you. But
start out. An’ whether it’s a livin’ man that you
find, or a chilled corpse, let <em>me</em> know first. Give
me two or three hours start, an’ then you kin go
to the law with your story.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
We were sorry for the frightened old man.
And we tried to tell him how foolish it was of
him to think for one minute that old Caleb had
actually been “voodooed.” There was another
explanation for the vanished one’s disappearance,
we said. But we couldn’t turn him.</p>

<p>“B’ys, you mean well enough, but you don’t
know what you’re talkin’ ’bout. No, you don’t.
I didn’t mention this part to you when I told you
the voodoo story, but it’s a fact that Ham <em>he</em>
died sudden, too. An’ thar on the wall by his bed—I
kin see it yet!—was a picture of a par’ot,
drawn with charcoal. A black par’ot! An’ when
they come to close his eyes they jest couldn’t make
’em stay closed at all—every time the eyes was
pressed shet they’d pop right open ag’in, jest like
the daid brain held a <em>secret</em> that the eyes was tryin’
dumbly to tell about. It’s a part of the voodoo,
b’ys—the starin’, glassy eyes. It was that way
with Bige Morgan, an’ it was the same with Ham.
You’ll see what I mean when you find ol’ Caleb.
And in that p’int, mebbe you better git started in
your search right away. I’ll wait here out of sight
till I git word from you, good or bad, only I
hain’t expectin’ nuthin’ but bad news, I kin tell
you that much.”</p>

<h4>A WILD NIGHT</h4>


<p>Well, we had something to think about now.
While we didn’t share the Cap’n’s crazy belief
that his old friend had been “voodooed” by the
escaped death parrot, it was a fact that we had no
other explanation to offer of the old townsman’s
sudden disappearance. And it did give us a kind
of queer feeling to know that the old man had
vanished on the heels of the parrot’s attack. His
disappearance seemed to bear out the voodoo
story, all right.</p>

<p>But, even so, we steadily refused to take any
stock in the crazy voodoo belief. The Cap’n’s
talk about his dead brother’s “glassy eyes” was
all bunk, we said. As for old Caleb, he would
turn up all right. We were sure of that. So
instead of wasting our time searching for him we
would give our immediate attention to capturing
the escaped parrot. That was the most important
job, we concluded.</p>

<p>It was our intention to secretly return the recovered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
parrot to its cage in the wall hole. Later
on, when Red had squared himself with his aunt,
we would tell the parrot’s owner the truth about
his bird’s unknown escape and its later supposed
“theft.”</p>

<p>We put in a busy forenoon. Covering the
small town, we separately searched the trees and
housetops. But, as before, we met with no
success. Solomon Grundy was nowhere to be
seen.</p>

<p>Nor did we see anything of Caleb Obed, though
we inquired for him at different homes where he
was known to drop in occasionally. No one with
whom we talked, even his closest friends, could
tell us where he was.</p>

<p>It was now brought home to us that the townsman’s
disappearance was a more serious matter
than we had imagined. So we gave his case our
main attention. Searching the still open house
for possible clews bearing on his disappearance,
we found a bloody towel in the kitchen. There
were dried blood spots, too, in the kitchen sink.
The sight of blood always gags me. Like castor
oil. So I kept away from the nasty towel. Nor
did I touch the sink where the bleeding man, after
his attack from the parrot, had plainly washed
himself and dressed his head wound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
In an old sugar bowl in the cluttered cupboard
we found a handful of silver coins and six dirty
five-dollar bills. This was proof to us that Caleb
hadn’t left town. For certainly, we reasoned, he
wouldn’t have gone away without his money, or
without locking it up.</p>

<p>But to make sure that the vanished one was
still in town we went to the depot where we inquired
of the ticket agent if the missing townsman
had spent any of his money in the past two
days for a railroad ticket. The agent shook his
head. He hadn’t seen anything of Caleb for a
week, he said.</p>

<p>The Cap’n was all broken up at our failure to
get track of the vanished one. He was unable
now to cook his own meals or otherwise wait
on himself. So it became our job to take care
of him. When I explained to Mother at the
supper table that my old friend wasn’t feeling
well and needed me at his store that night to wait
on him she readily consented to the plan. And
getting my pajamas I headed for down town.</p>

<p>Dusk came and I had seen nothing of my four
chums. Still, I knew they would be in the alley
later on. That was their plan. So I had no fear
of the spy.</p>

<p>The clock struck nine; then nine-thirty. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
having helped the weary old man out of his clothes
and into his nightshirt, I went to bed myself, on
the sitting-room couch, settling in comfort for
the night.</p>

<p>Suddenly I was awakened by a piercing scream.</p>

<p>“Jerry! Jerry! Hel-up! Hel-up!”</p>

<p>It was the Cap’n! And from the terror in his
screaming voice I could imagine that he was being
murdered in his bed.</p>

<p>To reach his bedroom I had to cross the sitting-room.
There was a puddle of moonlight on the
floor. I waded through it. My eyes picked out
a cane. I got it, wrapping my fist around the
small end. With its heavy gold head the cane
made a swell club.</p>

<p>But I had no occasion to use it. For there was
no one in the moonlit bedroom except the old
man himself, who was now sitting up in the bed.</p>

<p>“Jerry! Jerry!” the terrified voice rang
through the house.</p>

<p>I ran forward.</p>

<p>“Here I am,” says I.</p>

<p>I could see a pair of wild eyes in the moonlight.</p>

<p>“Jerry, I saw it. It was right thar by the foot
of the bed. An’ it—it——”</p>

<p>Here the voice broke. There was a sudden
dead silence. Gee-miny crickets! Maybe you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
think I wasn’t scared. I thought sure the old
man was dead. And I was all alone with him!</p>

<p>“Cap’n!” says I, shaking him. “Cap’n! It’s
me—Jerry. <em>Cap’n!</em>” But he never moved!</p>

<p>Well, you can see what an awful situation it
was for me. An “it” had scared the old man to
death. And for all I knew to the contrary the
“it,” whatever it was—human or otherwise—might
still be lurking in some dark corner of the
house to get a crack at me.</p>

<p>I got a light first of all. Then I looked under
the bed and in the clothes closet. Nothing oozed
at me. In the conclusion of my search a groan
came from the bed. I knew then that the old
man was still alive. So I wet a towel and mopped
his face as a quick way of bringing him back, to
his senses.</p>

<p>And right then I got a shock. I almost stared
my eyes out, I guess. For there on the unconscious
one’s naked breast, visible to me in the “V” of
the unbuttoned nightshirt, was a tattooed black
parrot.</p>

<p>Well, I stood there staring, as I say, my
thoughts jumping up and down. And then the old
man got his voice again.</p>

<p>“Jerry! Jerry! Hel-up! Hel-up!”</p>

<p>“Here I am,” says I, bending over the bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
“Jerry! I saw it. Jerry! Hel-up!”</p>

<p>I got Doc Leland on the telephone then. For
I could see that something was out of kilter in
the frightened one’s head. He kept calling my
name. Yet he didn’t seem to realize that I was
standing beside his bed.</p>

<p>I had urged Doc to come in a hurry. And
when he got there I explained to him how I happened
to be in the house. The Cap’n hadn’t been
feeling well, I said—his nerves had gone back on
him. So, in friendly service, I had agreed to stay
with him and wait on him.</p>

<p>The listener was puzzled at my story.</p>

<p>“Um.... He must ’a’ had a bad dream.”</p>

<p>I shivered.</p>

<p>“It was something worse than a dream, Doc.”</p>

<p>“You think he actually saw somethin’?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the world! Gosh, Doc, you should
have heard him. I thought at first that he was
being murdered. So I ran into his room. He was
sitting up in bed. His eyes were crazy. ‘Jerry!
Jerry!’ he screeched at me. ‘I saw it!’”</p>

<p>“It,” repeated Doc, holding me with his puzzled
eyes.</p>

<p>“He said ‘it.’ But I don’t know what he
meant.”</p>

<p>“It,” says the other again, working his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
thoughts. “Um.... Couldn’t ’a’ bin a man,
or else he would ’a’ said ‘him’ instead of ‘it.’”</p>

<p>In the excitement my mind had been too jumpy
to permit of clear thinking. But somehow I had
held to the belief that the spy was at the bottom
of the Cap’n’s scare. Now I was more at sea
than ever. For, as Doc had said, if the spy had
been in the house, and the Cap’n had seen him,
certainly the old man wouldn’t have said he had
seen “it.”</p>

<p>I was completely bewildered. What was it that
the frightened one had seen? What was the
nature of the peril that had visited him in the
dead of night? And, further, where had this
“peril” vanished to?</p>

<p><em>It!</em> Could it be that a ghost had wandered into
the store? I shivered in the thought of it.</p>

<p>Doc was working on the unconscious man now.</p>

<p>“Poor piece of tattooin’,” says he, pointing to
the chest design. “Amatoor work. Ol’ Caleb
Obed’s got the same kind of a Tom-fool thing
tattooed on him.”</p>

<p>Three black parrots! One on the chest of a
dead sailor; another on the chest of a man who
was strangely missing; the third on the chest of
a man who had just had the wits scared out of
him. And on top of all this a real black parrot—a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
living parrot of weird secrets. No wonder I was
befuddled in the mystery.</p>

<p>In the next hour the stricken man was removed
from his store to the emergency rooms. He was
a very sick man, Doc said. It would take a week
or two for him to get back on his feet. And in the
meantime he needed complete rest and careful
nursing.</p>

<p>In all this excitement, to my wonder, I had
heard nothing from my chums in the alley. And
the fear now came to me that something had happened
to them. So I hurried outside to find them.
But they weren’t there! Nor could I find any
trace of their ropes.</p>

<p>Br-r-r-r! The dark alley gave me the creeps.
And of no desire to stay alone in the store I lit
out for home. If my chums were in trouble they
would have to paddle their own canoe, I told myself.
For the night had already given me more
than my share of adventure.</p>

<p>It was two o’clock when Dad opened the front
door for me. At sight of me he wanted to know
if I had lost my mind in coming home at that
hour. I told him that the Cap’n had been taken
worse and had been removed to the hospital
rooms. He asked me several sleepy questions.
But I didn’t tell him everything.</p>

<h4>THE EMPTY GRAVE</h4>


<p>My chums got me out of bed the following
morning.</p>

<p>“We can’t find Cap’n Tinkertop,” says Scoop,
excited. “His store’s closed, too.”</p>

<p>I told the others where the old man was.</p>

<p>“Why weren’t you on guard in the alley last
night?” says I, feeling a little bit sore toward
them for not being on hand when I needed them.</p>

<p>Scoop laughed sheepishly.</p>

<p>“Jerry, I hate to admit it. But in a scrap last
night the Strickers got the best of us.”</p>

<p>“They locked us in a barn,” says Red, “and
kept us there till midnight.”</p>

<p>“So that’s where you were when I needed you,
hey?”</p>

<p>“Did you need us?”</p>

<p>I told them my story. They were excited, I
want to tell you. Poppy pressed me with eager
questions. Had I heard anybody in the store?—had
I noticed if any doors or windows were open?—had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
I searched the store after Doc’s arrival?—and
was I <em>sure</em> about the tattooed parrot on the
Cap’n’s chest?</p>

<p>I couldn’t answer “yes” to the first three questions,
but I could, and did, to the last one. Not
only was the chest design a black parrot, I
declared, but it was a duplicate of the one in the
dead sailor’s picture.</p>

<p>“And moreover,” says I, “old Caleb’s got the
same thing tattooed on him. For Doc told me
so.”</p>

<p>Visiting old Caleb’s house that morning, in the
hope of finding the old man there well and
unharmed, we came upon a yardful of excited people.
For some wag had started the story that the
vanished man had committed suicide. And what
led the neighbors to take stock in the story was
the known fact that the old man himself, on Monday
afternoon, had ordered a grave dug in the
Tinkertop lot in the old Scotch cemetery. He had
told the sexton, so it was said, that a body was
being shipped to the lot owner for burial. But to
date no body had been received at the local
express office. And everybody in Caleb’s end of
town was now saying that the vanished man, in
planning his intended suicide, had ordered the
grave dug for himself!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
We took no stock in this story. Caleb wasn’t
dead, we said. He was hiding. But <em>why</em> he was
hiding, and where, was a complete mystery to us.
Yet we believed that the black parrot was in
some way associated with the old man’s disappearance.
And we further believed that if we
could find him we undoubtedly would get the key
to the mystery that surrounded the strange
parrot.</p>

<p>Could it be, we then considered, that old Caleb
had something to do with the Cap’n’s scare? Was
he creeping out of his hiding place nights, to some
secret purpose? This was an exciting thought.
And as we were convinced now that the Cap’n’s
store—the death parrot’s home—was the center
of the mystery that involved the unusual black
bird, it became our decision to work in the store
that night instead of in the alley.</p>

<p>Meeting us at the store at dusk, Poppy fixed
five matches. I drew the long one, which made
me the “Cap’n.”</p>

<p>“What am I supposed to do?” says I, uneasy
in my prominent part in the night’s coming
adventure.</p>

<p>“Your job,” says the leader, grinning, “will be
to get into the Cap’n’s bed in a perfectly natural
way and pretend that you’re sound asleep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
“And then what?” says I.</p>

<p>“Something is trying to get the Cap’n. We
know that. It was here last night. And who can
say that it won’t come back again to-night to
finish its job?”</p>

<p>I shivered.</p>

<p>“It may grab me,” says I.</p>

<p>“If it does,” says Peg, laughing, “kiss it and
kill it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to kiss it,” says I, turning up my
nose, “if it’s old Caleb.”</p>

<p>“I <em>hope</em>,” says Poppy, serious, “that it’s the
spy.”</p>

<p>Scoop was puzzled.</p>

<p>“How can it be a man?” says he. “That would
be a ‘him,’ as Jerry says, and not an ‘it.’”</p>

<p>“Maybe it was a man dressed up like a ghost,”
says Peg.</p>

<p>“<em>Good</em> night!” says I, motioning for them to
clear the track for me. “I’m going home.”</p>

<p>But I was joking, of course. I hadn’t the
slightest intention of going home. Even if I was
to have a very risky part in the night’s coming
adventure I was determined to stay and see the
thing through.</p>

<p>Peg’s last remark had given us something to
think about. A ghost was an “it,” all right. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
what could be old Caleb’s object, or the spy’s, in
playing ghost in the Cap’n’s bedroom? And,
further, how had the “ghost” gotten into the
store?</p>

<p>It seemed to me that the mystery became more
confusing every minute. Instead of solving it step
by step, as we had done in other detecting jobs,
we were walking further and further into the
darkness.</p>

<p>“Let me get this straight,” says I to Poppy,
when they talked of putting me to bed. “You say
I’m to let you fix me up to look like the Cap’n, to
make the whatever-it-is think that I’m the old
gent himself. Is that correct?”</p>

<p>“You’ve got the right idea.”</p>

<p>“And then what?”</p>

<p>“You’re tucked into bed. See? The thing
comes. It’s after the Cap’n. Creeping up to the
bed, it takes a peek at you. It thinks you’re its
victim. And then—”</p>

<p>“<em>Hey!</em>” says I, cutting him off. “I thought you
said you were going to grab it before it grabbed
me?”</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Jerry. We won’t let it harm
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
“Just the same,” says I, shivering, “I’ve had
jobs I liked better.”</p>

<p>First they ruffled my hair and powdered it
with flour to make it white. Then they penciled
“wrinkles” into my cheeks with a burnt match.
A wad of chewing gum made a neat wart for the
side of my nose. For chin whiskers I was given
a whisk broom, held in place with a string tied to
my ears. I was even made to get out of my
clothes and dress my bare legs in the absent
householder’s long white nightshirt. A nightcap
was the finishing touch, after which, having put
me to bed with a great deal of joking attention,
the four crooks stepped back to view the results
of their dirty work.</p>

<p>“Hi, Cap,” says Peg, saluting.</p>

<p>“If you b’ys don’t quit pesterin’ me,” says I,
mimicking the old man, “I’ll run you out of here
on the end of my peg-laig.”</p>

<p>Poppy grinned.</p>

<p>“Jerry,” says he, “you ought to go on the stage.
For you’re a born mimic. Honest. Why, you
sound more like the Cap’n, and look more like
him, than the old man himself.”</p>

<p>“If I don’t look like a corpse before the night
is over,” says I, “I’ll consider myself lucky.”</p>

<p>When told to get into a hiding place in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
room Red parked himself behind the dresser. At
Poppy’s orders Peg and Scoop wedged themselves
into the clothes closet. The fourth one flattened
himself pancake fashion under the bed.</p>

<p>“Now,” says the leader, turning out his flashlight,
“let’s have silence and lots of it.”</p>

<p>My heart started to thumping in the sudden
darkness. And detecting a slight noise in the alley
I quickly turned my eyes to the window. Was it
the spy? Or was it a ghost?</p>

<p>The alley sounds dying away into a deep silence,
I started breathing again.</p>

<p>“If you fellows keep me here very long,” says I,
shivering, “I’ll be a nervous wreck.”</p>

<p>“Sh-h-h-h-h!” says Poppy.</p>

<p>“Why don’t one of you get in bed with me?”</p>

<p>“You poor fish!”</p>

<p>“You can pretend that you’re my wife. See?
We’ll hang a sign on the foot of the bed saying
that we’re newly married. So the ghost won’t be
surprised when it sees you here.”</p>

<p>“Keep still, I tell you.”</p>

<p>I saw a chance to have some fun. And reaching
for my clothes beside the bed I searched the
pockets for my ventrilo.</p>

<p>“B-b-blood!” says I, in imitation of the death
parrot. “Gu-gu-give me a bucket of b-b-blood!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
“You aren’t funny,” says Poppy.</p>

<p>“I killed H-h-ham!” says I, in further fun. “I
b-b-bit a hunk out of his liver and v-v-voodooed
him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come up there,” says Poppy, “and bite a
hunk out of your liver if you don’t dry up.”</p>

<p>“B-b-blood!” says I. “Gu-gu-give me a bucket
of b-b-blood!”</p>

<p>“B-b-blood!” came the echo from under the
bed, only Poppy said it so faintly and so muffled-like
that I hardly caught the word.</p>

<p>“Golly Ned!” says I. “You can do it better
than I can.”</p>

<p>“Do what?” says he.</p>

<p>“My, but you’re innocent!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t do anything. Honest.”</p>

<p>“Some one said, ‘B-b-blood!’”</p>

<p>“It was you.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t either. It was <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“All right,” says he, “have it your own way.
I’ll agree to anything you say if you’ll just shut
up.”</p>

<p>I had been told by the leader that I could
actually go to sleep if I wanted to, instead of pretending.
But you can bet your Sunday shirt that
I had no intention of doing that. Not so you can
notice it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
Everything was deadly still now. And in the
continued silence my mind picked up the voodoo
story. In imagination I saw the temple from
which the death parrot had been stolen by the two
sailors. I could see the building’s woven grass
walls and thatched roof. At the altar, where a
fire was sputtering and snapping, was the parrot
in its glittering cage. The smoke from the altar
fire had a stinking smell. It made me think of
Red’s sweaty feet. Half awake and half asleep
I got my chum’s feet mixed up with the parrot.
A pair of feet in a gold cage! What a funny
sight! And where was the parrot? Oh, yes, it
had been stolen. I could see a jungle now ... a
drifting raft ... a coral island ... a dead
man ... glassy, staring eyes....</p>

<p>Ker-<em>choo-o-o-o</em>!</p>

<p>Golly Ned! A gunshot directly in my ear
couldn’t have startled me any worse than the
sneeze that came out from under the bed.</p>

<p>“For the love of mud!” says I. “Why don’t
you kill a guy outright instead of scaring him
half to death?”</p>

<p>“Keep still,” says Poppy.</p>

<p>“Yah,” snickered the closet, “if you don’t quit
talking you’ll loosen your chin whiskers.”</p>

<p>Here the dresser came to life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
“Now what?” says Poppy, in disgust.</p>

<p>“I can’t find my club.”</p>

<p>“You and your club! We ought to use it on
your head.”</p>

<p>The dresser pranced around.</p>

<p>“For the love of Pete!”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to find my club.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you knock the house down?”</p>

<p>“Did I make any noise?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!”</p>

<p>“I’m awfully cramped in here.”</p>

<p>“Come and get in bed with me,” says I quickly.</p>

<p>“Stay where you are,” says Poppy.</p>

<p>Dong!... dong!... gurgled the sitting-room
clock in eleven mouthfuls.</p>

<p>“Now, fellows,” says Poppy, earnestly, “let’s
get down to business and quit our nonsense. For
this is a serious matter with me. Don’t forget
that Pa’s in jail, and the only way I can get him
out is by solving this mystery. So let’s be quiet,
as I say.”</p>

<p>In the silence that followed I heard a young
mosquito clatter up and down the window pane in
search of human blood. Tick! tock! tick! tock!
chattered the lively clock. Tick! tock! tick! tock!
I nodded under the monotonous sound. Tick!
tock! tick! tock! I nodded again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
Suddenly my dozing mind was jerked awake.
Like a powder flash. Something soft and feathery
had touched my bare feet. Under the covers.
Gee-miny crickets! You can believe it or not, but
I was out of that bed, sheets and all, in one jump.</p>

<p>“B-b-blood!” came a shrill stuttering voice.
“B-b-blood! Gu-gu-give me a bucket of
b-b-blood.”</p>

<p>Getting my voice, I yipped at the top of my
lungs.</p>

<p>“The parrot!” says I. “It’s in the bed!”</p>

<p>My chums sprang to life. I heard the closet
door fly open; and from the noise in the corner
where the dresser was I could imagine that Red
had turned that piece of furniture upside-down.
Then there was another sound—a crash of broken
glass.</p>

<p>Having dug me out of the mountain of bedclothes,
my chums told me that the screaming
parrot, in escaping from the room, had gone
through the window pane.</p>

<h4>IN THE OLD MANSE</h4>


<p>The black parrot’s crashing escape from the
Cap’n’s bedroom had left us dumb and dizzy. In
planning our night’s work we hadn’t expected any
such developments as this. In fact, we hadn’t
thought of the missing parrot at all. Certainly, it
never had occurred to us that the parrot was in
any way connected with its master’s scare. We
had thought of almost everything else <em>but</em> the
parrot.</p>

<p>Our first scattered conclusion was that the mysterious
bird was indeed possessed of uncanny
powers and could thereby come and go of its own
free will. But we quickly got away from that
crazy belief. The bird hadn’t gotten into the bed
of its own accord, we sensibly agreed. Some one
had put it there.</p>

<p>But to what purpose? Yes, <em>why</em> had the parrot
been hidden in the bed? Had the Cap’n been
secretly marked for death, like the old seadog in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
<cite>Treasure Island</cite>? And granting that either old
Caleb or the unknown spy was back of the evil
scheme, was it the belief of these two men, or one
of them, that the black parrot would fatally voodoo
its master when he got into bed?</p>

<p>I shivered at the thought of it.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Jerry?” says Peg, watching
me.</p>

<p>“That was some narrow escape for me,” says I.</p>

<p>“Fishhooks!” says he, laughing.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” says I, stiffening, “that <em>you</em> would
have let the parrot bite your leg off, hey?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” says he.</p>

<p>I didn’t say any more to him then. I wasn’t
going to let him think that I believed the voodoo
story if he didn’t. But just the same I watched
my chance and gave my bare legs a careful once-over.
And I’ll tell you truthfully that it was a
big relief to me to find that the parrot hadn’t
drawn blood on me with its bill. Now I was safe.
Whether the voodoo story was true or not I had
nothing to fear.</p>

<p>“It,” says Poppy, thinking. “We thought the
Cap’n’s ‘it’ was a ghost. But now we know it
was the black parrot.”</p>

<p>“We <em>think</em> it was the parrot,” says I.</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt about it in my mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
“But why didn’t the old man say ‘parrot’
instead of ‘it’?”</p>

<p>“I can’t answer that question any more than
I can answer a dozen others concerned in the
mystery.”</p>

<p>“And don’t forget,” says I, “that he said he
had seen ‘it’ at the foot of the bed—he didn’t say
‘it’ was <em>in</em> the bed.”</p>

<p>“What puzzles me,” Scoop spoke up, “is who
brought the parrot here. If there’s crooked work
going on, I can’t make myself believe that old
Caleb is at the bottom of it. For we know how
thick he is with the Cap’n. And in close friendship
like that he wouldn’t be likely to scheme
against the other one.”</p>

<p>Poppy had been listening attentively.</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” says he, “a good man is <em>made</em> to
do evil things.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Old Caleb may be a helpless tool of the other
man.”</p>

<p>“The spy?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p>“Aw!...” says Scoop. “I’d sooner think the
spy was working alone.”</p>

<p>“It gets my goat,” says Poppy, after a moment,
“that we can’t capture this man. We’ve been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
close to him—we’ve even seen him in the dark—yet
he always gets away from us. He could belong
in the moon for all we know about him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let that worry you,” says Peg. “For
we’re going to get him in the end.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” says Poppy, sort of dogged-like, “we’ve
<em>got</em> to capture him. We’ve got to do that in
order to clear Pa’s name.”</p>

<p>Scoop had gone to the broken window.</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” says he, wanting to do the
square thing by our old friend, “we’ll all chip in
and buy the Cap’n a new window glass. For
we’re sort of responsible for this accident.”</p>

<p>We took turns standing guard throughout the
balance of the night. But nothing happened. And
at seven o’clock we went home to breakfast.</p>

<p>While we were replacing the broken glass that
morning the Stricker gang meandered into sight.</p>

<p>“Window washers,” says Bid, getting a wrong
idea of our work.</p>

<p>“Flunkies,” says Jimmy Stricker, turning up his
nose at us.</p>

<p>“Cap’n Tinkertop’s pets,” says another one of
the smart Alecks.</p>

<p>Bid got real brave and put a foot into the
alley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
“Hello, Poppy,” says he. “Did you have a
nice time in the barn the other night?”</p>

<p>“We picked out a barn for you,” says Jimmy,
“because we thought you were a donkey.”</p>

<p>“Hee-haw! Hee-haw!” says Bid. Then he
came closer. “Say,” says he, in pretended
earnestness, “do any of you guys with strong
backs and weak minds know where I can borrow
a good wheelbarrow?”</p>

<p>He thought that was funny!</p>

<p>“Beat it,” says Poppy, “or I’ll tip this store
building over on top of you and sprain your good
looks.”</p>

<p>“Go on, you tramp! You couldn’t tip a mosquito
over.”</p>

<p>“I bet you anything you want to bet,” says I,
sticking up for our new leader, “that he can tip
<em>you</em> over with one hand.”</p>

<p>“<em>Him?</em> Don’t make me laugh. I might crack
my face.”</p>

<p>“If you did crack it,” says Scoop, “you wouldn’t
lose anything out of your head except water.”</p>

<p>“You guys are a bag of wind.”</p>

<p>“You’ll think we’re a cyclone,” says I, “when
we open up on you some day.”</p>

<p>“Talk’s cheap.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
“If you haven’t any other engagements this
afternoon,” says Poppy, “come around and we’ll
measure you up for a grave in our private
cemetery.”</p>

<p>Bid put out his chest then and raised his arm
muscles.</p>

<p>“When <em>I</em> came to this town to live,” says he,
strutting, “they had to put an addition on the
hospital.”</p>

<p>“Yah,” says Scoop, “I saw that room. It’s
padded on the inside and has your name over the
door.”</p>

<p>“Watch me spit! Every time I do it I crack
the sidewalk.”</p>

<p>“That’s nothing,” says Peg. “One time I
sneezed and blew the North Pole over.”</p>

<p>There was more of this crazy bragging talk.
Both sides enjoyed it. But I got mad as hops, let
me tell you, when one of the smart Alecks plastered
me with a mud ball.</p>

<p>Chasing the kid out of the alley with a club, I
came back to my chums fighting mad.</p>

<p>“Why do we always let them get the best of
us?” says I, wiping my muddy face. “Why don’t
we clean up on them?”</p>

<p>Poppy grinned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
“Hold your horses, Jerry. Our time’s coming.”</p>

<p>“Yah, and so is the end of the world—but I
don’t expect to live to see it.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to fix them to-night. Eh,
Scoop?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the world we are!” says the old
leader. “Remember what I told you the other
night at the medicine show, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“About the Indian’s ‘spirit letter’ trick?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. Well, Poppy and I have it all
framed up to work the letter trick on them
to-night. Spider Phelps is going to help us. We
need a man on our side. And we can trust Spider,
for he’s my cousin.”</p>

<p>I gave a tickled yip when the complete scheme
was unfolded to me. The fun we were going to
have! Oh, boy! A mud ball, or a dozen mud
balls, wasn’t one, two, three as compared with
what the Strickers were going to get.</p>

<p>However, I lost some of my enthusiasm that
noon. For I overheard something at the dinner
table that upset me.</p>

<p>Mother had a lot to say during the meal. She
had been down town that morning, she told Dad,
and had stopped at the emergency rooms to leave
some pansies with a sick neighbor lady who
recently had been repaired in the operating room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
“And while I was there I looked in on the
Cap’n. Poor old man! He’s still flighty. The
nurse says he has the strange hallucination that
old Caleb Obed has drowned himself in somebody’s
cistern.”</p>

<p><em>Cistern!</em> At the spoken word I suddenly
pricked up my ears. And my thoughts jumped
to Red.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” says Mother across the table, “is
there any truth in these stories that are going
around about old Caleb ordering a grave dug for
himself and then committing suicide in some out-of-the-way
place?”</p>

<p>Dad shrugged.</p>

<p>“That’s a queer thing,” says he slowly. “Caleb
ordered the grave dug, all right. I figure he’s
cuckoo.”</p>

<p>“Has he actually disappeared?”</p>

<p>“As completely as if he had walked off the
earth. I was talking with the marshal about the
case, and Bill tells me that he has ransacked the
town for the old coot without being able to find
hide or hair of him.”</p>

<p>Mother sighed.</p>

<p>“I hope the suicide story is untrue. For old
Caleb was the best cistern cleaner we ever had.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Negro Mose?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
“Oh, I can’t exactly complain of his work. But
I like old Caleb the best of the two. However,
if the latter isn’t available right now you had
better hire Mose. For I think our cistern ought
to be cleaned before a heavy rain comes.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see Mose on my way through town,” says
Dad.</p>

<p>Well, as you can imagine, I did some quick
work getting over to Red’s house.</p>

<p>“Your goose is cooked,” says I.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” says he.</p>

<p>“Old Mose is coming to our house this afternoon
to clean our cistern.”</p>

<p>That put a sick look on the other’s freckled
face. And while we were talking over the
unhappy situation, wondering if there was anything
that we could do to save ourselves, a fat
woman bustled into sight with an armful of rugs.</p>

<p>“Sh-h-h-h!” says I. “Here’s your Aunt Pansy,
now.”</p>

<p>“Don-ald,” says the fat one, in a voice that
was all honey and cream, “if you’ll come here,
like a dear little man, and shake these bedroom
rugs for Aunty I’ll make you a nice custard
pudding for supper.”</p>

<p>I beat it then. For it made me nervous to be
around Red’s aunt. And about two-thirty Poppy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
and the others came to my house in a delivery
wagon that they had borrowed from Scoop’s
store. Getting their signal, I ran into the street.</p>

<p>“Jump in, Jerry. Where’s Red?”</p>

<p>I told them of the freckled one’s predicament.</p>

<p>“He’s a goner,” says I. “For old Mose is
bound to find his truck in the cistern.”</p>

<p>“He sure was a dumb-bell,” says Scoop, “to
pull that burglar trick.”</p>

<p>“And as long as he was doing it,” says Peg,
“why didn’t he use his own cistern?”</p>

<p>“Search me,” says I, shrugging. “But he’d be
a lucky kid this minute if he had.”</p>

<p>Here Scoop got his eyes on something down
the street.</p>

<p>“It’s going to rain, fellows,” says he, laughing.
“Look at the dark cloud coming.”</p>

<p>The “dark cloud” was old Mose, a ladder
draped on one shoulder and a coil of rope hung
on the other. Each big hand gripped a pail
handle.</p>

<p>I figured that it would be safer for me to be
away from home when the silverware was brought
up. So I quickly scrambled into the wagon, driving
with the others to Peg’s house where we got
the “treasure chest,” a sort of home-made trunk
that his mother had dumped into the alley during
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
the spring housecleaning work. Made of heavy
wood, with a thick hinged cover, iron handles and
iron corner pieces, it was just the thing that we
needed for our “buried treasure” trick. Scoop’s
father sells all kinds of cheap novelties in his
store, and going there, our chum got four tiny
red wheelbarrows.</p>

<p>Our truck gathered up, we then headed out of
town on the Treebury pike. In Happy Hollow a
familiar freckled face came into sight over the
weeds beside the road.</p>

<p>“Hi,” says Red Meyers, waving to us.</p>

<p>Poppy pulled on the lines.</p>

<p>“I thought you were home reënforcing the seat
of your pants,” says he.</p>

<p>“Where you headed for?”</p>

<p>“The old Scotch cemetery.”</p>

<p>“Hot dog! You can give me a lift.” Here the
speaker bent over and tugged at something in the
weeds. “Gosh, but this truck is heavy.”</p>

<p>Say, you should have seen the bundle of stuff
that he had! Kettles and pans and a baseball
bat and a catching glove and bread and canned
beans and I don’t know what all.</p>

<p>“Are your folks moving?” says the leader.</p>

<p>“No, I’m running away.”</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
“I’m headed for Montana.”</p>

<p>“Haw! haw! haw!” says Peg, in his rough way.
“Why didn’t you bring along the kitchen stove
and the player piano?”</p>

<p>I couldn’t believe at first that Red was in
earnest about running away from home. Still,
I reflected, it was just like him to start out this
way with a wagon load of silly truck. He sure
is rattleheaded.</p>

<p>There was a fearful clatter as the runaway
pitched his frying pan and kettles into the wagon.</p>

<p>“Lookit!” says I, hooking a book. “‘Tricked
at the Altar,’” I read.</p>

<p>“It belongs to Sis,” says the sweating worker,
shooing the flies off his hunk of boiled ham.</p>

<p>“Since when,” says the grinning leader, as the
runaway wedged himself into the seat with us,
“did you get this grand and glorious idea of
populating Montana?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it just came to me when I was flipping
Aunt Pansy’s rugs. So I grabbed my stuff and
beat it.”</p>

<p>“But what’s the <em>idea</em>?”</p>

<p>“You ought to know.”</p>

<p>“The silverware in the cistern?”</p>

<p>“That and the dead parrot.”</p>

<p>“Aw!...” says Peg, serious. “You aren’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
really going to run away from home to escape a
licking, are you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing else but.”</p>

<p>“Red, you’re crazy. Why, kid, you won’t get
two miles from here before your folks catch you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a scheme.”</p>

<p>“Yah?”</p>

<p>“You know the old manse in the Scotch
cemetery?”</p>

<p>“Where the sexton keeps the coffin cases?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p>Peg glanced back at the “treasure chest” and
quartet of toy wheelbarrows.</p>

<p>“We ought to know the place,” says he, laughing,
“for we’re headed for there this very
minute.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to hide there,” says the runaway.
“For two or three weeks. Everybody will think
I’m in Chicago or somewhere. See? They
won’t think of looking for me so close to home.
Then, when the coast is clear, I’ll make my getaway
into the West.” He unfolded his arms in a
sweeping gesture. “Oh, you Montana!” says he.
“The wild and woolly life for me. Injuns. Mountain
lions. Gila monsters. Rattlesnakes.”</p>

<p>Well, the rest of us fairly busted ourselves
laughing at this silly talk. For it’s a fact that Red
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
Meyers has about as little grit as any kid in
Tutter. On a camping trip one time he found a
spider in his pancake and was gaggy for a week.
I had a picture of him living a “wild and woolly”
life in Montana. Oh, yes! He didn’t know a
Gila monster from a camel’s egg. As for chumming
with rattlesnakes, if he thought there was
one in the same county with him he’d shiver his
back teeth loose.</p>

<p>But we let on to him that we swallowed his
crazy talk. It was fun for us.</p>

<p>Coming to the cemetery in which Caleb Obed
had so strangely ordered a grave dug, our eyes
curiously sought the pile of fresh dirt. The grave,
we noticed, was covered with a canvas to keep it
dry in case of a sudden shower. Through the big
pine trees in the background we could see the
dilapidated old manse, the place that the four of
us were heading for with our “treasure chest,”
and also the place where the runaway was intending
to lay low until the way was clear for him to
skin out for Montana.</p>

<p>A more direct course for us to have taken
would have been through the big cemetery gate,
but it was our scheme not to attract attention, so,
passing the cemetery, we turned into a wood-lot
road to the left. Winding here and there in this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
unfrequented road, dodging low-hanging limbs,
we presently drew up at the back door of the
manse. Tying the horse to a fence, we first helped
Red unload his truck, then, leaving the runaway
to manage his own affairs, the four of us headed
for the manse cellar with the chest and the four
toy wheelbarrows.</p>

<p>In this windowless and doorless old building,
a storage house for wooden coffin cases, the sexton
kept his grave-digging tools. And helping ourselves
to a pick and three shovels we quickly
descended a flight of rotten wooden stairs into
as damp and spooky a cellar as ever I had been
in. Thinking of the near-by graves, I got a sudden
case of cold shivers. But I quickly got over
that feeling. For whatever idea I had of dead
people coming back to earth it wasn’t to be believed
that a ghost or spook would be likely to
meander into the manse cellar at this time of day.
The time for ghosts to do their stuff was in the
dark. I knew that.</p>

<p>Well, getting quickly to work, we marked off a
spot three feet from one wall and six feet from
another, sort of in a corner, and there we dug a
hole in the dirt floor about four feet deep. The
hole completed, we put the toy wheelbarrows into
the chest, locked the cover with a rusted padlock,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
and then dropped the box into the hole, covering
it with dirt, flush with the floor.</p>

<p>Peg wiped his sweaty face.</p>

<p>“I’m glad that job’s done,” says he. “Wow!
I’m wringing wet.” He looked around at the
shadowy corners. “Say, this is a spooky hole!
A dozen black cats could hide down here and we’d
never know it.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” says I, starting for the stairs.
“Let’s get out of here. I don’t like the smell. It
comes from the dead people on the other side of
the wall.”</p>

<p>Scoop sniffed.</p>

<p>“Um...” says he. “It smells like a dead
rat to me.”</p>

<h4>THE HAUNTED CISTERN</h4>


<p>Coming out of the cellar, we found everything
in the runaway’s quarters in apple-pie order. To
one side was a sort of provision shelf made of two
long coffin cases piled one on top of the other. On
another similar shelf the frying pan and kettles
were neatly arranged. In the middle of the room
was a sort of library table, built up of small
coffin cases. Here we found the runaway hard
at work copying a farewell letter to his folks
from the book, “Tricked at the Altar.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be right,” says he, “for me to skip
out to Montana without telling Ma something
about my plans. For she might worry.”</p>

<p>Peg, the big monkey, lugged in an iron cemetery
settee. It brightened up the room, he said, and
made it more homelike. Then he brought in a
withered “Gates Ajar” flower piece that had been
thrown away. There was nothing like having
things cheerful, he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
But the pencil pusher was too deep in his letter writing
job to give any attention to the nonsense
that was going on around him. I looked in the
book to see what he was copying. Here it is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Father</span>:</p>

<p>Unable to longer endure my unmerited
shame, I am going to the river. It is my last
earthly wish that my innocent child shall be
brought up never to know the cruel trick that
was played on its unfortunate mother at the
altar. Good-by, forever. May I know a happier
fate in the next world.</p>

<p class="center">
Your erring daughter,<br>
</p>
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Tessie</span>.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>I let out a yip.</p>

<p>“For the love of Pete!” says I. “I hope <em>that</em>
isn’t the letter you’re writing to your mother.”</p>

<p>He glanced up.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m changing it,” says he. “How’s this?”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>:</p>

<p>Unable to longer endure my shame in having
killed Aunt Pansy’s parrot, I am going to Montana
to be a cowboy and scalp Indians and Gila
monsters. It is my last earthly wish that you
give Jerry Todd the custard pudding that Aunt
Pansy promised to make for me for supper. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
will see that I get it and not eat it himself.
Good-by, forever.</p>

<p class="right">
Your erring son,<br>
<span class="smcap">Donald</span>.<br>
</p>

<p>P.S. Please give Jerry a spoon with the custard
as I forgot to bring one along.</p>

<p>P.S. If you haven’t got your spoons out of
the cistern yet you needn’t bother about sending
me one. I can eat the custard without a spoon.
But be sure and sugar it.</p>
</div>

<p>“Some kid, Red is,” says Peg, when we were
on our way home in the delivery wagon.</p>

<p>“Some bluffer, you mean,” says Scoop, with a
grunt.</p>

<p>I thought of the note that I was carrying to the
runaway’s mother.</p>

<p>“Maybe he means business,” says I, thoughtful.</p>

<p>“<em>Him</em> run away?” says Peg, hooting at the
idea. “Tell me next that the moon is made of
green cheese and see if I believe <em>that</em>.”</p>

<p>Poppy laughed at his thoughts.</p>

<p>“After a night or two in the old manse he’ll
be glad enough to go home to Aunt Pansy and
take his medicine.”</p>

<p>“And what Aunt Pansy will do to him,” says
Peg, whistling. “Spat-spat-spat on his china
end.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
I squirmed at the turn of the conversation.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” says I gloomily, “he isn’t the only
kid in Tutter who’ll get a spat-spat-spat on his
china end.”</p>

<p>Coming into town, the others let me out of
the wagon close to my home.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you coming, too?” says I to Poppy.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“I guess I better go down to the jail and see
Pa. For he gets lonesome for me.”</p>

<p>“We’ll meet you after supper at the medicine
show,” says Scoop. “The invisible-ink letter is
all written, telling about the wonderful buried
treasure in the old manse cellar, and I’ve fixed it
with Spider Phelps to hook one of the Indian’s
sheets to-night when they’re passed out and switch
it for mine. See? Then Spider’s going to offer
my sheet to Bid, who, of course, will jump at the
chance of getting a ‘spirit letter.’” There was a
contented laugh. “And this is <em>some</em> letter, eh,
Poppy?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the world!” says the leader.</p>

<p>“I can imagine Bid’s excitement when he reads
it,” says Scoop. “He’ll show it to his gang, of
course, for he won’t have the nerve to go into the
cemetery all alone. We’ll have an eye on them.
And when they start for the cemetery to dig up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
the treasure we’ll take a short-cut and get there
ahead of them, hiding to see the fun. Red will
be on the lookout for us. I told him not to show
a light. And we’re to give a ‘mewing cat’ signal,
so he’ll know for sure that it’s us, and not the
enemy.”</p>

<p>I more than half suspected that Mother or Dad
would be waiting for me at the front door with
a paddle. So I didn’t put on any speed in approaching
the house. To the contrary I sort of
piecemealed along.</p>

<p>But, to my surprise, the house was closed.</p>

<p>“Looking for your folks, Jerry?” says Mr.
Dodson, who lives next door to us.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” says I.</p>

<p>“The marshal was here this afternoon to see
your pa about something. Then Mr. and Mrs.
Meyers came over and they all drove away in the
direction of Ashton.”</p>

<p>Well, this was cheerful news!</p>

<p>Two hours passed and still my folks hadn’t
come home. But this didn’t surprise me. The
county courthouse is in Ashton. That is where
the Tutter people go to get marriage licenses and
dog tags. And now I had the feeling that my
parents were at the courthouse trying hard to get
a pardon for me. They undoubtedly believed me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
to be as guilty as Red. But even so they wouldn’t
want to see me go to jail. For I was just a boy.
More than that I was <em>their</em> boy. And they loved
me.</p>

<p>When dusk came I went down town. And who
should I bump into, in turning a corner, but Bill
Hadley himself. At sight of the marshal’s big
star I pretty nearly panaked.</p>

<p>“Kid,” says the officer, putting a heavy hand on
me, “I’ve bin lookin’ fur you.”</p>

<p>I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t.</p>

<p>“Lulu kept supper waitin’ on you fur mor’n
an hour,” says Bill, naming his wife, an old school
teacher of mine, as I say, and a chum of Mother’s.
“What’s the idea of disappointin’ us? Don’t you
like our grub? Or didn’t you git your ma’s
note?”</p>

<p>“Note?” says I, dizzy.</p>

<p>“I was up to your house this afternoon talkin’
with your pa about goin’ fishin’. Then Mr. and
Mrs. Meyers come over and started coaxin’ your
folks to go with them to some kind of a party in
Ashton. Your ma said she didn’t like to go away
and leave you to git your own supper. ‘Shucks,’
says I, ‘me an’ Lulu we bin wantin’ Jerry to come
over to our house to supper fur a coon’s age.
You jest trot along,’ says I, ‘an’ we’ll take care
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
of Jerry an’ see that he gits plenty to eat.’ Your
ma left a note fur you on the hall table. Didn’t
you find it?”</p>

<p>“No,” says I, and I sort of felt myself over to
make sure that I wasn’t dreaming. I had expected
him to drag me off to jail. And here he was talking
to me like a chum!</p>

<p>Well, he took me into a restaurant and ordered
some fried potatoes and beefsteak for me, with a
lot of stuff on the side like apple pie with ice
cream on it and two kinds of bread and dill
pickles and fried cakes and jello and pears. There
was pudding, too, and strawberry shortcake and
some kind of a salad with chopped-up red peppers
in it. Still dazed, I ate everything they set out.
They brought me a second portion of meat and
potatoes and I ate that. There was a big bowl
of soup crackers near my plate and I ate that. I
didn’t leave a single cracker. As I look back the
wonder to me is that I didn’t eat the toothpicks
or gnaw a hunk out of the wooden counter. With
the law standing behind me, urging me on, eating
seemed to be a sort of duty. So everything went
down.</p>

<p>Bill was called away before I had the counter
cleaned off. I was glad of that. He had talked
to me like a friend, but I couldn’t quite get away
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
from the worried feeling that I’d wake up and
find myself in handcuffs. Besides I was having
hard work now to get the food down. I didn’t
seem to have any room for it.</p>

<p>Staggering out of the restaurant, I bumped into
Tommy Hegan, a neighbor kid.</p>

<p>“Golly Ned!” says he, laughing. “You sure
did scare the wits out of old Mose this afternoon.
He thinks your cistern is haunted. How did you
work it, Jerry?”</p>

<p>I loosened my belt and drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>“Work it?” says I. “Work what?”</p>

<p>“The voice.”</p>

<p>“What voice?”</p>

<p>“The voice in the cistern that said, ‘Polly wants
breakfast.’ I laughed when Mose told me about
it. He says he wouldn’t go near your cistern
again, to finish the job of cleaning it, for a hundred
dollars. It was a pretty slick trick, all right.
Tell me how you worked it, Jerry.”</p>

<p><em>Red’s parrot!</em> I saw the whole thing in a
flash. He had dumped the parrot into the cistern
along with the other stuff. And instead of being
dead, as we had supposed, the bird had been in
a faint. And now it was recovered! And the
law as yet hadn’t found out about the silverware!</p>

<p>Boy, was I ever glad! Hoop-a-la! I kicked up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
my heels, only I couldn’t kick very high because
my tight stomach was sort of in the way of my
knees. Then down the street I went, lickety-cut,
and into our back yard.
</p>

<p>“Polly!” says I, putting my head into the black
cistern. “Polly!”</p>

<p><a id="breakfast"></a>“Breakfast,” came a wilted hollow voice from
the in-flow tile. “Polly wants breakfast.”</p>

<p>The thing to do, I figured out quickly, was to
tell Red that his parrot was alive and then help
him get it out of the cistern. It would help our
case if we could get the bird back into its cage
before our folks returned from Ashton. And if
we could succeed in bailing up the silverware so
much the better.</p>

<p>I started for the cemetery on the run, telling
myself that things were looking a lot brighter for
us. And now comes the part of my story that
always gives Mother the shivers.</p>

<h4>VOODOOED</h4>


<p>Coming to the dark cemetery, I paused to get
my wind, my eyes anxiously seeking the path that
I had to take among the tombstones in order to
reach my chum. How weird the white shafts
looked in the filtered light! They seemed to be
crouching, listening. I shivered, dreading at the
moment to enter the spooky place.</p>

<p>Then I got a grip on myself. It was only a
person’s fear of dark cemeteries, I told myself,
that made such places dangerous. It wasn’t the
scheme of the dead to harm the living.</p>

<p>So, entering the cemetery in bolstered courage,
I hurried along the gravel road, trying not to let
myself believe that something was following me.
But I kept looking back as a sort of precaution. I
couldn’t help it. Try going through a cemetery
some dark night and see how <em>you</em> feel. Once a
branch twisted under my foot and slapped me on
the leg. Boy, did I ever jump!</p>

<p>The pines that I passed under were a hundred

years old. And there were tombstones in the
cemetery fully as old as the trees. Once upon
a time a Scottish church, called a kirk, had stood
on this hill. A fire had wiped out the church.
But the manse and the churchyard remained.</p>

<p>I had to pass close to the empty grave. And at
sight of it queer thoughts crept into my mind.
Had Caleb actually ordered it for his own use in
strange foreboding of his early death? Had he
been voodooed? Was he dead, as the Cap’n
suspected?</p>

<p>“Dea-a-ad!” mournfully whispered the pines,
picking up the thread of my thoughts. “Dea-a-ad!
Dea-a-ad!”</p>

<p>Coming to the old manse, a black pile in the
crowding darkness, I put my head in at the door.</p>

<p>“Red,” says I, breathing my chum’s name.</p>

<p>There was no answer. Remembering about the
cat signal, I gave a loud, “Meow!” Still no
response from within.</p>

<p>“Red,” says I, louder. “It’s me—Jerry. I’ve
got some good news for you.”</p>

<p>Lighting a match, I stepped, trembling, into the
building, my eyes seeking a safe path. The frying
pan and ham, I noticed, were on their respective
coffin-case shelves. But of the runaway himself
there was no sign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
“Red,” says I again, raising my voice. “<em>Red.</em>”</p>

<p>What I didn’t know was that the “runaway”
had gone home, like the big baby that he was at
heart. His “Montana” talk was all a bluff. In
sending the note home he had figured that his
mother would make me tell her where her “erring
son” was. Then, of course, mamma and Aunt
Pansy, all flustered, would hurry around to the
front door of the manse with the family sedan,
begging Sonny, on bended knees, to please come
home again and give up his intended scheme of
scalping Indians and Gila monsters. In getting
him back into the family circle their joy, of
course, would be so great that they would forget
all about wanting to punish him.</p>

<p>Oh, Red’s tricky, all right! But what had sort
of upset things for him was the unexpected
absence of his folks. His mother being away, I
had been unable to deliver his note, and consequently
no one had come for him, as he had
expected they would, with the willing promise
that all would be forgiven. He had held out
until sundown, and then, shaking, had lit out for
home. Late that night his folks found him sound
asleep on their back porch, the empty custard
dish in his lap.</p>

<p>But, of course, I didn’t know about the runaway’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
deceitful scheme until later on. And searching
for him unsuccessfully in the old manse, I
became terrified at the thought that something
had happened to him.</p>

<p>“Red,” says I in a trembling voice. And going
to the doorway into the cellar I peered down the
stairs. “<em>Red.</em>”</p>

<p>The rotten stairs suddenly collapsing under my
weight, I was pitched, screaming, into the dark,
foul-smelling hole. Plaster and rubbish showered
around me. Feeling about to get my bearings,
my left hand suddenly touched something yielding.
Like an inflated football. I froze in sudden
horror. For I knew that the thing I had touched
in the dark was no football, but <em>a dead man’s
face</em>.</p>

<p>I fumbled in my pocket for a match. Getting
one, I struck it. The small blaze gave me a
glimpse of a stretched-out form that had been
hidden from our sight that afternoon by the
stairs. As I had suspected, it was old Caleb
Obed!</p>

<p>I hadn’t believed the voodoo story in first hearing
it—it was a crazy tale, I had said. But after
the mysterious appearance of the black parrot in
my bed I had been doing some thinking. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
now I knew the truth of the matter. There was
no longer room for doubt. The parrot’s story
was only too true.</p>

<p>How I got out of that stairless hole I don’t
know. But I did get out, somehow. And, screaming,
I ran out of the cemetery and down the road
into town, where, completely forgetting about my
promise to the Cap’n, I sounded the alarm of the
tragedy in the street. When the story got to Bill
Hadley’s ears he loaded his flivver full of excited
men and drove up the Happy Hollow road on
the tear.</p>

<p>Realizing that Dad ought to know the truth
about my part in the death parrot’s escape, I ran
home, still trembling, determined to tell my parents
the whole story from beginning to end. For
I realized that immediate steps should be taken
to kill the weird parrot. Otherwise it might
voodoo some one else. Every minute that it was
permitted to live human lives were in danger.</p>

<p>Finding the house still in darkness, I switched
on the lights. As I did so the clock struck ten.
How queerly I felt! I suddenly noticed it. I
worked my dizzy head on its rubbery support.
Then I noticed a peculiar pain in my left foot.</p>

<p>Taking off my shoe and stocking, I found a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
swollen ankle. The foot had been bleeding, too.
There were matted drops on my big toe.</p>

<p>Puzzled at first to account for the injury, I
suddenly remembered that <em>this</em> was the foot that
had touched the voodoo parrot in the bed.</p>

<p>Say, if ever there was a scared kid in the whole
history of the world it was <em>me</em>. The terrible
thought jumped into my head that I had been
voodooed. The parrot had nipped me in the bed
without the slight injury showing at the time.</p>

<p>I tried hard to fight down my fears. I didn’t
want to believe that I had been voodooed. For,
if I had, I would die. There were no “if’s” and
“and’s” about that. The result of the voodoo
was <em>death</em>. The Cap’n had said so, and Caleb
Obed’s death had proved it. The bare thought
of it drove me out of my senses.</p>

<p>“Dad!” says I, running madly through the
empty house. “Dad! Mother! Dad!”</p>

<p>But there was no one there to help me.</p>

<p>Then to my great joy the front door bell rang.
In the hall my hand touched something cold ... the
marble-topped table. <em>Marble!</em> I shrank back
in horror. For marble was what tombstones
were made of.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” bowed the man at the door,
and I saw in added horror that he carried a bouquet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
of calla lilies. “I am a stranger in town.
Can you direct me to the home of Mr. W. W.
Graves?”</p>

<p><em>Graves! Calla lilies!</em> I slammed the door
shut in the stranger’s face, for I could think of
him only as an omen of death itself. Suddenly
weak in the knees, I dropped, panting, into a seat
in the hall. <em>Marble! Graves! Calla lilies!</em> The
sweat ran down my cheeks.</p>

<p>The dizzy feeling was now in my crammed
stomach. Everything that I had eaten for supper
was going around and around. First the strawberry
shortcake chased the dill pickles, then the
jello played horse with the pepper salad. To
vary the lively program, the pears and everything
else lined up in a game of leapfrog.</p>

<p>I had turned on the parlor lights, wanting to
drive away every particle of darkness. And there
on the parlor wall within range of my eyes,
nodding at me in the bright light, was my dead
Grandfather Todd’s picture. The eyes held a
new expression. They seemed to be <em>beckoning</em>
to me.</p>

<p>Was I crazy?</p>

<p>I ran out of the house. The shortcake now
had a strangle hold on the jello’s windpipe. The
latter’s death struggles grew fainter and fainter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
Then the beefsteak, galloping to the jello’s rescue,
kicked the shortcake in the seat of the pants and
the fight started all over again.</p>

<p>I bumped into a man in the street.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Jerry,” says Mr. Ump. My eyes
bulged at sight of the long package under the sexton’s
arm. All I could think of was a new shovel.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, having tripped on the sidewalk
in front of Mr. Kaar’s undertaking parlor,
I tumbled into Doc Leland’s office, where I faced
six or seven surprised men, among them Bill
Hadley and Scoop’s father. A meeting of some
kind was in progress. But the meeting broke up
in a hurry, let me tell you, when I galloped into
the room, capless, wearing only one shoe and
stocking, yelling to Doc to get busy and save my
life.</p>

<p>Springing up, Bill took my arms and drew my
face close to his.</p>

<p>“Why, Jerry!” says he, searching my eyes.
“What’s the matter?” Then he laughed. “Have
you found another ‘dead man’?”</p>

<p>The whole story came out then—how we had
let the death parrot escape and how it had voodooed
Caleb Obed, killing him, and how I had
been voodooed in the Cap’n’s bed, and, in consequence,
had been seeing graves with marble tops
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
and sextons carrying long-handled strawberry
shortcakes trimmed with calla lilies.</p>

<p>“Um ...” grunted Doc, getting the hang of
my wild story. “H’ist up that foot that’s bin
voodooed an’ let me take a peek at it.”</p>

<p>The men were laughing now. And I wondered
at it.</p>

<p>“Um ...” says Doc, examining the inflamed
ankle. “Bin swimmin’ in the creek, hain’t you?”</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“P’ison ivy,” says he, with a grunt. Thumping
me in the stomach, he inquired what I had had
for supper.</p>

<p>“Beefsteak and fried potatoes,” says I, “and
strawberry shortcake and pepper salad and dill
pickles and jello and apple pie with ice cream on
it and pears and——”</p>

<p>“That’ll do,” says Doc, and he acted as though
he was sort of disgusted with me. I guess he had
the idea that I had been eating too much. I was
beginning to think so myself.</p>

<p>Bill was laughing his head off now.</p>

<p>“Why, kid,” says he, patting me on the back
to brace me up, “you hain’t bin voodooed. That
fall of your’n into the cemetery cellar upset your
nerves. You’ve bin lettin’ yourself imagine
things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
Mr. Ellery winked at Doc.</p>

<p>“I think,” says he, laughing, “that the boy’s
stomach has been upset worse than his nerves.”</p>

<p>“Old Caleb hain’t dead, Jerry,” Bill went on.
“You thought he was. But he hain’t. We
brought him home a few minutes ago. He’s
drunk, that’s all.”</p>

<p>I was still dizzy.</p>

<p>“And he wasn’t voodooed?” says I.</p>

<p>Bill laughed and gave me another friendly pat
on the back.</p>

<p>“Kid,” says he, “you’re funny.”</p>

<h4>WHAT WE CAPTURED</h4>


<p>Doc Leland had me lay down on a couch in
his office while he doped my ankle with medicine.</p>

<p>“Um ...” says he, in the course of his work.
“How does that feel?”</p>

<p>“It stings,” says I, fidgeting.</p>

<p>“Of course it does. But that hain’t a-goin’ to
kill you.”</p>

<p>I was told then that I would be all right again
in a few days, but I wasn’t to do any more swimming
in the creek. For the sluggish stream was
full of poison, Doc said.</p>

<p>The meeting was going on in the room. And
from the earnest conversation of the business men
I gathered that they were up in arms over old
Caleb’s spree. It was a disgrace to the community,
Mr. Ellery declared.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a boy growing up,” says he, meaning
Scoop, “and if I am to expect him to properly
respect his country’s laws, and abide by them, I’ve
got to do my part, as a parent and citizen, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
you fathers have got to do the same, to see that
the laws are obeyed. In short, gentlemen, we’ve
got to set our growing boys a good example in
law enforcement and cease this milk-and-water
attitude of ours toward a vicious traffic that we
know exists in our midst. That is why I suggested
this informal meeting.”</p>

<p>“I have said right along,” says Mr. Fisher of
the Chamber of Commerce, nodding in approval
of Mr. Ellery’s speech, “that we could stop the
moonshine traffic if we got together.”</p>

<p>Bill’s face reddened.</p>

<p>“Is that an insinuation, Fisher, that I hain’t
bin doin’ my duty?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” says Mr. Ellery quickly. “We
didn’t get together to-night to criticize anybody
but ourselves. The point is, as I see it, that we,
as a community, have been entirely too lackadaisical
in our support of our officer.”</p>

<p>“Until lately,” says Bill, “we hain’t had an
awful sight of ‘moon’ in town. As fur old Caleb’s
case, I’ve got a’ idear who sold him the stuff.
But if we were to raid the guy I doubt if we’d
git any evidence. Fur them fellers is reg’lar
snakes in coverin’ up their tracks.”</p>

<p>“Who is this bootlegger?” says Mr. Fisher.</p>

<p>Bill gave a name that surprised and excited me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
“Why! ...” says I, drawing the attention of
the men to my couch. “Maybe this bootlegger
is the burglar.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s dead silence.</p>

<p>“By gum,” says Bill, giving me a warm look,
“I never thought of <em>that</em>.”</p>

<p>Doc’s office adjoins the emergency rooms. And
at this point the public health nurse tapped on the
connecting door and entered.</p>

<p>“I thought you might want to know,” says she
to Doc, “that Cap’n Tinkertop has partially
regained his senses. He tells a queer story about
a ghost—as I understand it, the ghost of a dead
sailor brother. It might quiet him if you were to
talk with him.”</p>

<p>“Um ...” says Doc. “So he’s got somethin’
to tell us about a ghost, has he? That must ’a’ bin
the ‘it’ that he seen night before last.”</p>

<p>Here the Cap’n himself pottered into the room,
having gotten out of bed of his own accord.</p>

<p>“Caleb,” says he huskily, searching the room
with restless troubled eyes. “Caleb. Hais any
of you gentlemen seed anything of ol’ Caleb
Obed? I’ve bin lookin’ fur him. But I kain’t
find him.”</p>

<p>Doc got the trembling patient safely into a
chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
“Saturday,” says the old man, mumbling to
himself. “Ham said—I was to give him—the
money—on Saturday night. Ham said——”</p>

<p>“He’s talking about his brother,” says I to
Doc.</p>

<p>“But his brother’s dead.”</p>

<p>The old man’s ears caught this.</p>

<p>“Yes,” says he, nodding slowly, “my brother’s
daid. Ham, I mean. But he come back. He
allus said he would, an’ he did.” Again the
troubled eyes searched the room, as though the
muddled brain was seeking a way out of its confusion.
“Don’t you un’erstand? It was his <em>ghost</em>
that I seed—his <em>spirit</em>. I woke up sudden. An’
thar he was at the foot of the bed. An’ he said—he
said—I was to give him back—his money. He
said—I haid lost his par’ot—I haidn’t kep’ my
part of the ’greement—an’ I was to give him back
his money—on Saturday night.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ellery had been listening attentively.</p>

<p>“What money is he talking about, Jerry?”</p>

<p>I explained about the insurance money.</p>

<p>The merchant gave a dry laugh.</p>

<p>“I never was quite foolish enough to believe
in ghosts,” says he, “and particularly am I unwilling
to take stock in a ghost that tries to collect its
own insurance money.” He paused in deep
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
thought. “I wonder,” he went on, “if we aren’t
in touch with some kind of a scheme to defraud
the insurance company that carried the two-thousand-dollar
policy. To that point, this man
Ham may not be dead at all. He may have faked
a death, scheming to recover the insurance money
in trickery from his not overly bright brother.”</p>

<p>Bill was grim now.</p>

<p>“I’m beginnin’ to think,” says he, waggling,
“that they is some close connection between this
bootlegger an’ the Cap’n’s ghost. Fur, as Jerry
says, the robberies followed this feller’s appearance
in town, so why not this other trick, too?
Anyway, this bein’ Saturday night, we’ll jest do a
little investigatin’ in that quarter.” Pausing, he
looked at me and laughed in his rough way.
“How would you like to git in the Cap’n’s bed
ag’in, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ doin’,” says I, shivering.</p>

<p>“No? Well, calc’late we’ll have to use Fisher
then. Fur he’s jest about the Cap’n’s size. Come
on, men.”</p>

<p>“I’m going, too,” says I, jumping up.</p>

<p>I looked for my chums in the street, but to my
disappointment they were nowhere in sight.
Presently we turned the corner into School Street.
In the Cap’n’s store Mr. Fisher got into the old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
man’s bed, as I had done the preceding night,
while the other men distributed themselves
throughout the store in good hiding places. I
was in the bedroom closet with Bill. And, boy,
maybe you think I wasn’t excited!</p>

<p>There was a long wait. At least it seemed
like an age to me. I heard the sitting-room clock
strike eleven; then eleven-thirty.</p>

<p>Suddenly a hand pressed mine in the dark.</p>

<p>“There!” says Bill, breathing the word in my
ear.</p>

<p>I had heard the sound, too—some one, or
<em>something</em>, was on the roof. Yet I had to stretch
my ears to detect the light, muffled footsteps. We
heard the scuttle open. There were parrot-like
footfalls in the attic. Then the trapdoor in the
sitting-room ceiling was drawn up. Following a
short, deep silence, a rope fell with a slight thud
to the floor. To a deep sleeper all of these
sounds would have passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>We had left a lamp burning low in the room.
And through the crack in the closet door I now
saw the dead sailor’s “ghost” approach the foot
of the bed, white-faced, its eyes staring and glassy,
its breast bared to show the tattooing. At this
point the bed creaked slightly. Afterwards the
men joked Mr. Fisher, accusing him of shivering.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
And to that point maybe he did shiver. It
wouldn’t have been so very surprising. Even
with my hand in Bill’s I sort of shivered myself.</p>

<p>“B-b-boaz Tinkertop,” stuttered the ghost, in
a graveyard voice, “you have lost my p-p-parrot.
You have let it fall into e-e-evil hands. So, having
broken your s-s-solemn promise to me, I
d-d-demand my money back. <em>Give me my
m-m-money!</em>”</p>


<p>Here Bill threw open the closet door and
flashed his gun.</p>

<p>“Hands up!” he roared, which was a signal
for the other men to tumble into the room.</p>

<p>Well, my story really ends with the “ghost’s”
capture. As you probably have guessed, the
“ghost” was the Indian medicine man. But the
captured one was no real Indian—he was a
younger black-sheep brother of the Cap’n’s, a
man long since disowned by his two older law-abiding
brothers. At one time he had been a
character actor in an Indian play, which explains
how the “Indian” idea had become fixed in his
head. Of a naturally tricky mind, traveling
around the country in his later years in Indian
disguise selling fake medicine publicly and moonshine
secretly was stuff to his liking.</p>

<p>Angered in getting no lawful share of his oldest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
brother’s life insurance money, he had thought
up the scheme of stealing the death parrot from
its new owner and playing “ghost,” knowing how
very superstitious the Cap’n was. It was to find
out where the black parrot was hidden in the
store that he had spied through the alley windows.
Fortunate for his evil purpose he had seen us
take the strange parrot out of its wall hole, as I
have written down. That was on Monday night—his
first night in town. On Tuesday night he
had robbed the brickyard safe. Having found
in old Caleb a steady customer for his moonshine,
he had gone to the old bachelor’s home late
Wednesday night, hoping to sell still more liquor.
In the open house he had seen the stuffed black
parrot, and, stealing it in a queer turn of humor,
had directly afterwards switched it for the sooted
parrot. In stealing the live parrot that night he
had thought, of course, that he was getting possession
of Solomon Grundy. Later that same
night he had robbed the Meyers’ home. And
how the sooted parrot got away from him there
you already know.</p>

<p>To-day as a result of his evil life he is in jail.
The money that he stole from the brickyard safe
was recovered, and out of the three thousand dollars
we got five hundred dollars. Dad groaned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
in paying us this big amount of money. But he
had promised us one hundred dollars apiece if
we captured the burglar, so he had to keep his
word.</p>

<p>Poppy rented a home on Elm Street with his
share of the money and stocked the house with
stuff to eat. He bought some second-hand furniture,
too. However, he didn’t have to buy very
much furniture, for our folks gave him a lot of
stuff. Mr. Ott, of course, was freed, but I really
think he was sorry to leave his comfortable cell.
Strange to say a warm friendship had sprung up
between the old man and Bill. And to-day these
two men get together and talk “detective” stuff
by the hour. Poppy says, though, that his father,
now a regular employee of Dad’s, has given up
all hope of ever being a successful sleuth.</p>

<p>A rough man, Ham Tinkertop had taught his
weird parrot its “blood” talk. And it was the
sailor, tattooed himself, who had tattooed his
two brothers and old Caleb. There was no mystery
in the tattooing on the Cap’n’s and old
Caleb’s breasts, nor was there any mystery in the
dead sailor’s odd picture. As for the new grave,
it was generally concluded that old Caleb had
been drinking when he had ordered the grave dug.
I am glad to write down in conclusion that we got
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
the old man to sign a temperance pledge. And he
has kept his word, too. To-day he hates the filthy
stuff. I wish all men hated it. For, as Dad says,
moonshine is poison. And the thing for a fellow
to do, if he has any pride in himself, is to leave
it alone. Bu-lieve me, I’m never going to act
smart when <em>I</em> grow up and drink any of the rotten
stuff.</p>

<p>If Mrs. Strange ever got track of her stolen
mino bird I never heard about it. It wasn’t her
dead bird that old Caleb had. I sometimes think
it was a lucky thing for me that her bird was
stolen. For it was through the bird’s theft that
Poppy came to our town to live. I sure do like
that kid. I never expect to have a pal that I like
any better. And he feels the same way toward
me. It’s bully to have a pal like that. So, as I
say, I can’t feel sorry that the Cedarburg
woman’s bird was stolen. What was her loss
was my gain.</p>

<p>Able again to take care of his bird business, the
Cap’n confessed to us one morning that in his
fear of the death parrot he had secretly advertised
the bird for sale. He knew he was doing
wrong. His conscience had hurt him, he said.
And this probably explains why he had been so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
terror stricken when the dead man’s accusing
“ghost” came.</p>

<p>That same week we captured Solomon Grundy
in Bid Stricker’s hen house. Bid himself had
earlier caught the bird, and, in an intended trick
on the parrot dealer (he had found out somehow
that the Cap’n had lost a black parrot), had put
the bird in the old man’s bed, not knowing that the
storekeeper had been taken to the emergency
rooms. The enemy chief kept out of our sight
while we were in his yard. He has given us a
wide berth ever since his recent “adventure” in
digging up a certain “buried treasure” consisting
of four five-cent toy wheelbarrows!</p>

<p>Oh, yes, in conclusion I must tell you about
poor Red. I slipped into his yard the Monday
after Bart Tinkertop’s arrest, and there sat funny face
on the back porch steps polishing silverware
to beat the cars. He had a cushion under him.
His aunt was on the porch feeding crackers to her
half-starved parrot. And when I meandered
around the corner of the house she looked at me
as though I was some miserable thing that the
cat had dragged in. So I promptly meandered
back home again.</p>

And that is all for this time. In another book,
POPPY OTT’S SEVEN-LEAGUE STILTS, I
will tell you how my new chum and I went into
business and made considerable money. Boy, did
we ever have fun! A smart rich kid who thought
he was better than us tried to kick our business in
the seat of the pants. But, bu-lieve me, <em>he</em> got a
kick in the seat of the pants before we got through
with him. The things Poppy did, with my help,
make a mighty interesting story, I think. There
is a strange old man in this new book. Br-r-r-r!
Through him we became entangled in a most
amazing and most bewildering mystery. Talk
about a shivery adventure! If <em>you</em> don’t shiver
when you read this new book, the title of which
I have given above, I’ll miss my guess.</p>
